			<h3>Mobile broadband  </h3>
			<p>We remain committed to upholding the broadband penetration rate in Sri Lanka by continuing to provide exceptional user experience and ever affordable options to consumers. </p>
			<p>With the roll-out of LTE technology, Mobitel customised its portfolio of products to adapt to this network and gave customers incentives to move onto it as well; through the introductions of tariff plans and device plans.

			<h2>&#9;Customer Care and Service Improvements</h2>
			<h3>Information on products and services  </h3>
			<p>We engage with customers through diversified means to provide accurate and relevant information on our products and services; as well as to obtain feedback on our operations. The channels we employ include one on one interactions, our contact centre, SLT’s corporate website and social media accounts, mailers and newsletters, brochures, our customer satisfaction survey, ICT workshops, enterprise customer forums and finally, customer visits and meetings. We use traditional media channels to market and advertise our products and services to the general public. </p>
			
			<p>In addition, our account managers frequently visit our enterprise customers to ensure that they are receiving all the support they require from SLT. Enterprise customers are equally furnished with the contact details of senior staff to escalate any issues to attention resulting from any discordances in expected service levels. </p>
			
			<p>We have established a distinct hotline, 1212, for customers to obtain information and log concerns. This is a 24-hour service with zero cost to the customer. Any resulting user comments are entered into our operational support system (OSS). This helps us in refining our services as appropriate for further improvements in customer care. </p>
			
			<h3>Contact centre  </h3>
			<p>Our contact centre recorded a total of 10,285,016 calls in 2016; of which circa 7 million were to agents. A customer satisfaction rate of 91% was recorded throughout the year; and as at the year end; customers reported a 79.06% satisfaction rate with the contact centre staff. We were also able to fulfil the service level KPIs established by the Government Centre: GIC (1919) and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) in this domain. The GIC Index noted that 95.15% of calls were answered within 15 seconds, and a corresponding call abandonment rate of less than 5% was recorded. Similarly, the SLIC Index showed that 98.20% of calls were answered within 20 seconds, with a call abandonment rate of less than 2%. </p>
			
			<h3>Complaint management  </h3>
			<p>We have an established and detailed process in place for the handling of customer complaints.</p>
			
			<p>Any complaint received by the contact centre and enterprise help desk are entered to the OSS, and forwarded to the corresponding work group. A trouble report will remain in the system unless it is attended to and the matter resolved. The officer in charge of the work group oversees the system and organises resources to address the issue. The officers are themselves monitored by deputy general managers. The Plant Maintenance and Customer Service (PM &amp; CS) Unit conducts an age analysis of existing trouble reports and conveys results to relevant senior officers. Samples of closed trouble reports are selected, and relevant feedback is obtained from the customers who lodged the initial, corresponding complaint. We take necessary further steps if the customer is still not satisfied. </p>
			
			<h2>  Knowledge sharing </h2>
			<h3>Fixed ICT operations  </h3>
			<p>We engage in knowledge sharing activities with enterprise customers through customer forums, individual discussions, product launches and the inauguration of national initiatives. </p>
			
			<p>We conduct customer forums and annual conferences for the benefit of SME customers. These events allow decision makers to meet the top management at SLT. We equally get the opportunity of receiving direct customer feedback during these times. </p>
			
			<p>We equally use social media as a tool in developing our customer relationships. Social media allows for the disbursement of knowledge and information, as well as the posing of inquiries and handling of complaints, in real time. </p>

			<p>*&#9;The decline in the CSI for enterprise customers is explained by the complex nature of integrated solutions and high scale of service-level agreements that are required by this sector due to high expectations of valued enterprise customers.</p>
			
			<p>We were able to extrapolate several findings from this study. Our performance in resolving billing, payments and maintenance issues appears to be strong. We need to improve our social media delivery response, as customers usually require a high level of attention and service from us in this domain. </p>
			
			
			<h2>  Customer Engagement</h2>
			<h3>Fixed ICT - Marketing campaigns &amp; promotions  </h3>
			
			<p>We rolled out several marketing campaigns and promotions to drive awareness of our products and services to the general public. </p>
			
			<p>Under the Sisu Abhiman programme, we rewarded the top 21 students who had achieved the highest results in the GCE (A/L) examination island-wide. These students were provided ultra high-speed broadband connections to aid in the entire duration of their undergraduate studies. </p>
			
			<p>Under the Sisu Connect scheme, we organised a series of seminars for grade 5 students sitting for the scholarship exam. We were able to demonstrated our SLT call tutor service and additional products to interested students and parents. </p>
			
			<p>Through the MyBill Promotion scheme, we enlightened our customers on this web-portal based billing service. This was done through the circulation of e-flyers as well as the distribution of promotional leaflets. </p>
			
			<p>We equally organised the SLT e-sports championship 2016 for all the devoted online gamers of Sri Lanka. This was one of the ways we continued to position ourselves as being an ideal broadband solution for the gaming and youth communities. </p>
			
			<p>A comprehensive list of other promotional activities and campaigns can be accessed from our corporate website. </p>
			
			<h3>Mobile ICT – Marketing campaigns & promotions</h3>
			<p>We revamped our ‘cash bonanza’ programme in 2016 to include 12 luxury Mitsubishi Monteros as first prize for each month. This rewarded our users on a daily and monthly basis by distributing a spectacular sum of Rs. 350 million throughout 2016. This was the largest prize give-away by a telecommunications operator in Sri Lanka. </p>
			
		<p>Our mCash platform equally launched a ‘Pay bills with mCash to win big’ promotion to all its mCash users to encourage them to use the mCash App to make utility bill payments. </p>
			
			<h2>&#9;New Enterprise Business ICT Solutions and MOUs</h2>
			<h3>Fixed ICT operations  </h3>
			
			<p>We engaged with numerous high profile clients throughout the years to furnish them with ICT solutions and related services. To note were the optical fibre and VPN connections we provided to hotels operated by Serendib Leisure Management, the call centre solutions we afforded to Singer (Sri Lanka) and the VOIP services we provided to Union Assurance PLC. A full list of our operations can be accessed from our corporate website and press releases. </p>
			
			<p>SLT will equally equip the soon-to-be completed Colombo Lotus Tower; the tallest building in South Asia; with cutting-edge technology and ICT services. </p>
			
			<p>We have signed MoUs with the Faculties of Engineering of the Universities of Peradeniya, Moratuwa and Ruhuna to carry out Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities.  </p>
			
			<h3>Mobile ICT operations  </h3>
			<p>We partnered with Lanka BPO academy to extend our mLearning portfolio to include distance-learning courses offered by the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment (CISI).  </p>
			
			<p>We similarly joined hands with Colombo Dockyard PLC to develop a cutting-edge vehicle detection system for vehicles stationed at the dockyard. </p>
			
			<p>A partnership with Emerging Media (Private) Limited resulted in the creation of the myjobs.lk website. This is a online job-listing platform in Sri Lanka, destined for both prospective employees and recruiters. </p>
			
			<h3>SLT presents cloud-based micro services </h3>
			<h3>architecture  </h3>
			<p>SLT, together with the efforts of the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) conducted a knowledge-sharing programme titled ‘TechTalk’. The programme dealt with the topic of cloud-based microservices architecture. The event witnessed significant participation from software and application developers and coding professionals based in Sri Lanka. </p>

			<p>We witness that the ICT industry is changing rapidly, and as a result our customers are increasingly into the automation and digitisation of processes. Thus, SLT is geared towards delivering solutions to fit these increasingly digital lifestyles. </p>
			
			<p>The general populace is increasingly adopting the services being offered by OTT players. We can counterbalance this by focusing our efforts on enhancing the Internet services that are on offer that enable customers to access OTT operations in the first place. This can be done through the implementation of higher data rates for enhanced connectivity. Nonetheless, we will have to address the growing data traffic which may arise from the increasing adoption of these services. The cost of accessing the Internet will also diminish with time due to the developments in new technology. </p>
			
			<h3>Enterprise customers  </h3>
			<p>Enterprise customers do not pose straightforward requirements to us. They require customer solutions that are technically complex and collaborative. We need the participation of systems and integrators for this purpose. </p>
			
			<p>We witness that our clients are increasingly seeking digital and automated services. We see opportunities in several industry areas in the enterprise domain. For example, banks in Sri Lanka are increasingly shifting their services onto digital platforms. Equally, the Government has various ICT initiatives, such as the LGN 2.0 network, which SLT has been given the unique opportunity to oversee and collaborate on.</p>
			
			<p>With the surge in economic development of the country, we will witness an influx of investors. These investors will require ICT solutions when they execute their operations, so we witness ample market opportunities there as well. One of our strengths is that we offer a comprehensive package of ICT solutions under our OPEX model. </p>
			
			<p>We equally see exciting new prospects in developments such as the Megapolis project; whereupon we will deliver ever-sophisticated services to satisfy the diverse needs of the varying businesses being established there. </p>
			
			<h3>Small and medium enterprises  </h3>
			<p>For SME customers, we ensure that we do a detailed analysis of the customer profile, and try to understand their specific business challenges. We then devise plans with regards to their ICT requirements to aid in the digitisation of their operations. And thereupon, we see opportunities. We notice that some customers are very keen to embrace these technologies, but some others require more time. Whatever their need, SLT ensures that it is part of the joint engagement of client and supplier as a valued partner. </p>
			
			<h3>Public sector institutions  </h3>
			<p>We are anticipating the launch of GS3+ which will be a fortuitous opportunity for us, as a lot of factories will open under this; for which we can provide ICT solutions. </p>
			
			<p>Recently, we were instrumental in the government’s removal of the embargo on fishing exports. This was enacted by the European Union (EU) to stop unsustainable and illegal fishing practices. SLT expedited a vessel monitoring system that was developed through our own subsidiary. This was a GPS-based vessel monitoring system; and until such a system was in place, the EU did not want to withdraw the embargo. We completed this process within three weeks and the restrictions were successfully raised. </p>
			
			<h3>Wholesale  </h3>
			<p>We usually offer our wholesale customers solutions in connectivity and vanilla products; to which there are no added value. </p>
			
			<h3>International  </h3>

			<p>We do witness market opportunities here in terms of voice, but there is an overall decline in revenues in this sector due to users migrating to OTT applications to avoid high call charges. Our capitalisation of the non-voice segment of the market (the data segment) is slightly less than the voice segment. </p>
			
			<p>We are dealing with international carriers, and currently have around 80 plus interconnection agreements in the pipeline, to which we add between ten and fifteen interconnections each year. We contact interested parties and liaise with them to understand their ability to grow our business, and vice versa. In addition, we entered into some voice-commitment agreements (VC agreements) and swap deals with some carriers. </p>
			
			
			<h2>  Network Infrastructure and Ongoing Development Projects</h2>
			<p>In 2015, we invested Rs. 17.6 billion in developing Sri Lanka’s ICT infrastructure and introducing new technologies to our customers. We continued these efforts in 2016, investing over Rs. 20.1 billion on the ICT infrastructure development by the end of 2016. </p>
			
			<p>We completed Phase V of the i-Sri Lanka project whereupon we extended the reach of optical fibre to roadside cabinets furnishing Internet speeds of up to 20 Mbps to customers. Our island-wide network of optical fibre extends to over 25,000 km. </p>
			
			<p>High-demand areas were provided with a fibre to the home (FTTH) network with broadband speeds of up to 100 Mbps. We implemented fixed 4G LTE wireless broadband networks to cater to broadband demand beyond the reach of wireline networks. </p>
			
			<p>A carrier grade Wi-Fi project was launched to enable the public to use their home broadband at public locations. </p>
			
			<p>The brand new submarine cable system (SEA-ME-WE 5), delivering data at over 48 Tbps, was launched to increase the speed and reliability of Sri Lanka’s connectivity to global regions. </p>
			
			<p>We commenced the construction of a new data centre at Pitipana-Homagama, which will be completed in the second quarter of 2017.</p>
			
			<h3>Network connectivity  </h3>
			

			<p>SLT’s existing network is a layered one. It is on this that we categorise our connectivity facilities. An access layer permits a customer to gain initial access to the network. </p>
			
			<p>We possess over 25,000 km of optical fibre dispersed throughout the island constituting 2.5 million loops. We equally possess over 300 nodes connected throughout the country which accumulates all traffic from various points in the island. Thus, based on requirements we can route information to the required place in a few milliseconds. </p>
			
			<p>The core transmission network is equally built with an ultra high-speed capacity and cutting-edge routers. </p>
			
			<h4>Capabilities  </h4>
			

			<p>Mobile broadband is capable of providing download burst speeds of 55 Mbps with LTE and 30 Mbps with 3G. Our fixed broadband options provides a speed of up to 20 Mbps with a capacity exceeding 50 GB.  </p>
			
			<p>Our fibre optic network offers users bandwidth up to 100 Mbps. Customers in the SME segment and individual users requiring greater bandwidth at high speed are provided with a segmented facility which extends speed beyond 20 Mbps. This is achieved through an unique system termed a ‘pond network’. We can meet the demand for even greater requirements in speed and capacity. </p>
			
			<h4>4.5G LTE  </h4>

			<p>We have successfully trialled 4.5G LTE advanced pro technology in Sri Lanka. This is capable of delivering speeds exceeding 1 Gbps. We were the first organisation to trial this technology in South Asia. We look forward to commercially deploying this service in the near future. </p>
			
			<h4>i-Sri Lanka project  </h4>

			<p>We have successfully completed the above project, whereupon Sri Lanka is now one of the most ICT-connected countries in South Asia. We served around 70,000 households through FTTH technology by the end of 2016. </p>

<p>i-Sri Lanka Programme Closing Ceremony.</p>
			
			<h4>Customer needs  </h4>
			<p>We understand that customers require high-speed, greater volumes and low latency in their broadband and ICT connections. We continue to address these requirements, as best as we possibly can. </p>
			
			<h3>Global connectivity  </h3>

			<p>Our ISP network is the premier in the country, and meets the standards of the global ICT industry. With five submarine cables under our belt, from SEA-ME-WE 1 to SEA-ME-WE 5, we are well poised to compete with international players in the industry. This will help secure Sri Lanka as a regional digital hub, and add the country to the world’s PoP network. We can also refine the country as the choicest IT-BPO/Data Centre destination. Further details about the cable systems and associated projects can be found on our corporate website. </p>
            
            <p><img src="../images/mda_img4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
            
<h4>International backhauling network  </h4>
			<p>SLT provided a global connectivity backhauling facility to international operators. This was by establishing a full landing status of the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable station in Matara. The network consists of three cable stations at Colombo, Mount Lavinia and Matara joined to the international back-haul hub at Welikada. The benefits of this venture are manifold, as operators are able to use the system to terminate traffic in Sri Lanka, cross-connect with other systems and even enhance their carrying capacity. </p>
			
            <p><img src="../images/mda_img5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
			
            
			<h3>Data centre (Tier 4)  </h3>
			<p>SLT is building the first tier 4 data centre in Sri Lanka. This will benefit our enterprise customers as well as Government entities by eradicating their need for maintaining individual data centres. We will be providing all manner of expert knowledge to users and subsidising costs associated with the venture. The data to be stored at the centre is guaranteed to be safe and secure from external disturbances. </p>
			
			<h3>The National backbone network  </h3>
			<p>Our backbone network is made up of 300 career Ethernet nodes and 64 SLBN nodes. It is available and functioning at all times, due to a comprehensive 1+2 redundancy system. Our network is of high quality, speed and capacity backed with a low latency; and is hence a veritable asset in the country’s development. </p>

            <p><img src="../images/mda_img6.jpg" alt=""/></p>

			
			<h3>Lanka Government Network (LGN 2.0)  </h3>

			<p>The LGN is a strategic project that is designed and implemented to link and upgrade Government entities, using a single network. SLT has set up a LGN fibre optic network to cover 315 Government establishments, and will provide these with Internet speeds of up to 100 Mbps, along with a host of other benefits. The network will significantly increase the efficiency and productivity of Government processes; which will consequently benefit the public as well. </p>
			
			<h3>Carrier grade Wi-Fi project  </h3>
			<p>Through this scheme, SLT provides an unique broadband experience for Internet users, whereupon users can connect to SLT/Mobitel Wi-Fi hotspots and experience the convenience of wireless broadband connectivity. These hotspots are continually expanding to cover all public locations of major cities in Sri Lanka. </p>
			
			<h3>Building digital ecosystems – API economy  </h3>

			<p>Mobitel believes that the economies of the future will be run by digital services. By extending its efforts in becoming a fully-consolidated digital service provider, we will address this upcoming trend. Mobitel has already opened a cutting-edge API gateway and continues to refine this service to higher standards. </p>
			
			<h3>Future projects  </h3>
			<p>SLT is focused on constructing a port depot to store maintenance infrastructure as required. We are also working in collaboration with several international entities to secure maritime vessels equipped for cable repair.</p>
