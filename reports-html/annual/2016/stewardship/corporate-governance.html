			<h3>Ownership and Directors  </h3>

			<p>As per the shareholding structure of the Company, two major shareholders namely the Government of Sri Lanka acting through the Secretary to the Treasury and the Global Telecommunication Holdings NV recommend five and four Directors respectively to the Board. The Board as empowered by the AoA of the Company appoints them to the Board filling the casual vacancies after deliberation of their qualifications, experience and expertise in relevant functional areas by the R&amp;NC. However, all Directors are required by the Company’s AoA to be elected by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, if appointed by the Board. A Director must also retire by rotation and may seek re-election at the AGM if he or she was last elected or re-elected at or before the AGM held in the third year before the year in question.</p>
			
			<h3>The role of the Board  </h3>

			<h3>Operation of the Board  </h3>

The meetings focus on the overall strategic direction, development and control of the Company.</p>
			
			<p>The Chairman, along with the Group Chief Executive Officer (‘GCEO’) and the Company Secretary, ensures that the Board functions effectively and has established Board processes designed to maximise its performance and effectiveness.</p>
			<p>Key aspects of these processes are:</p>
					
				
            <ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>All Directors receive appropriate and timely information in order to ensure informed deliberation and effective decision-making. Briefing papers are distributed by the Company Secretary to all Directors usually four working days prior to the Board and Committee meetings. The Board papers are made available in electronic format keeping in line with the Group’s sustainability initiatives.</li>  
			
			<li>The GCEO along with the respective Chief Officers and the Heads of Divisions present their submissions to the Board and provide the necessary clarifications requested by the Board. The Board, once satisfied with the recommendations made by the management approves the proposals.</li>
			
			<li>The Board has a procedure for Directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense. In addition, all Directors have access to the advice and services of the Secretary, who advises the Board on appropriate procedures for the management of its meetings and their duties, as well as the implementation of corporate governance and compliance with the requirement of the Companies Act, CSE Listing Rules and the Articles of Association of the Company.</li>

			<h3>Independence of Directors and segregation of duties</h3>

			<p>Non-Executive Directors are not members of management and are free of any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with – or could reasonably be perceived to interfere with the independent exercise of their judgment. They do not hold shares in the Company and have not worked in an executive capacity for the Company or any of Subsidiaries of the Company.</p>

			<h3>Role of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer  </h3>

			<h3>The Company Secretary  </h3>

            </ul>
			
			<p>The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.</p>
			
			
			<h2>  Internal Control and Risk Management</h2>
			<p>The Board ensures that internal controls and risk management are properly established and maintained through the Audit Committee whose responsibility is to oversee the internal control and risk management. The Board was directly involved in assessing the risks associated with the business and of the Company through the risk management process. There is established continual monitoring built into work processes assessing new and potential risks from bottom up flow. </p>
			
			<h2>  Strategic Governance Boards (‘SGB’) </h2>
			<p>Strategic Governance Board comprising the GCEO and the chief officers of each functional area are given the responsibility of studying the requirements of cross functional areas and introducing solutions in a transparent manner. </p>
			
			<p>The seven cross functional governance boards previously introduced have been reduced to four in an attempt to improve in capital investment decision, enhance supply chain management and better utilisation of Group resources. </p>
			
			<h2>  Codes of Conduct and Practice</h2>
			<p>SLT has a Code of Conduct that applies to all employees and third parties who deal with the Company.

The processes and standards in the Code are intended to enhance investor confidence and rapport, and to ensure that decision-making is properly carried out in the best interests of the Group. </p>
			<p>The Code covers areas such as equal opportunity employment practices, workplace health and safety, conduct in the workplace, business conduct, protection of SLT’s assets, proprietary information and intellectual property, data protection, confidentiality, conflict of interest, and non-solicitation of customers and employees.

			<h2>  Material Contracts </h2>
			<p>There are no material contracts entered into by SLT or any of its subsidiaries that involve the interests of the GCEO, any Director, or the controlling shareholders, Secretary to the Treasury and the Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V.</p>
			
			<h2>  Remuneration </h2>
			<p>SLT’s GCEO is the head of the management and is, therefore, remunerated as part of senior management. The R&amp;NC recommends the salary package of the GCEO to commensurate with his qualifications and experience for the approval of the Board. The GCEO’s performance is assessed based on the key performance indicators agreed upon at the time of entering into the fixed term contract with the Company. </p>
			
			<h2>  Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors </h2>
			<p>The R&amp;NC reviews and proposes the Non-Executive Director’s fees based on the experience and skills of the Directors and the complexity of the Group’s business and operations, for the approval of the Board.</p>
			
			<p>For the financial year ended 31 December 2016, the fee for the current Chairman remained unchanged as before as per Board approval granted in year 2008.  </p>
			
			<p>The fees for Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman comprised a basic monthly fee for attendance of Board and Board’s Subcommittee meetings. No additional fees for attendance at Subcommittee meetings were paid to the Non-Executive Directors. </p>
			
			<p>The cost of travelling and accommodation incurred by the overseas Directors who were required to travel out of their country to attend Board and Subcommittee meetings are reimbursed.</p>
			
			<p>The aggregate Directors’ fees paid to Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 was Rs. 18 million.</p>
			
			<p>Mr W K H Wegapitiya, who was appointed to the Board in December 2015 has declined to accept a Director-fee and offered his monthly Director-fee to a charitable organisation. </p>
			
			
			<h2>  Remuneration of Senior Management </h2>
			<p>The remuneration framework and policy is designed to support the implementation of the Group’s strategy and to enhance shareholder value. </p>
			
			<p>The following are the principles for remuneration to senior management:</p>
			
            <ul class="list list-disc">
			
			<li>Select appropriate performance metrics for annual and long-term incentive plans to support business strategies and ongoing enhancement of shareholder value</li>
			<li>Offer competitive packages to attract and retain highly experienced and talented individuals</li>
			<li>Link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance, both on an annual and long-term basis</li>
			</ul>			
					
				
			
			<h2>Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting </h2>
			<p>The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and all shareholders are encouraged to participate. The Chairpersons of the Subcommittees will be available at the AGM to answer any questions from the shareholders. </p>
			
			
			<h2>  Major Transactions </h2>
			<p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Companies Act, to disclose to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to the SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2016. </p>
			
			
			<h2>  Statement of Compliance </h2>
			<p>SLT is fully compliant with the requirements stipulated in Section 7.10 on ‘Corporate Governance’ of the Continuing Listing Requirements of the Colombo Stock Exchange issued in 2010 and subsequent amendments/guidelines thereto issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. See the tables on pages 31 and 32 for the rules on ‘Corporate Governance Principles’ and the degree of compliance to the said rules. </p>
			
			<p>In addition, the Board of Directors to the best of their knowledge and belief is satisfied that all statutory payments due to the Government, other regulatory bodies and those payments related to employees of SLT, have been made on time.</p>
