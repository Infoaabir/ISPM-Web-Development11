			<p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Companies Act, to disclose to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2017. </p>
			<h2>  Related party transactions</h2>
			<p>The Board of Directors has applied the rules issued by the CSE on related party transactions throughout its decision  making process to avoid any conflicts of interest that may occur. The Board has recognised the importance of a Related Party Transactions Review Committee under the Board of Directors to enhance corporate transparency and promote fair transactions between SLT and its subsidiaries. </p>
			<p>The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries disclosed in Note 34 to the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, the Board believes those transactions are exempted in accordance with exceptions specified in the Listing Rules. All these are recurrent transactions and are in the ordinary course of business of the Company. </p>
			<h2>  Statement of compliance</h2>
			<p>SLT is fully compliant with the requirements stipulated in Section 7.10 on “Corporate Governance” of the Continuing Listing Requirements of the Colombo Stock Exchange issued in 2010 and subsequent amendments/guidelines thereto issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. See the tables on pages 106 and 107 for the rules on “Corporate Governance Principles” and the degree of compliance to the said rules. </p>
<p>In addition, the Board of Directors to the best of their knowledge and belief is satisfied that all statutory payments due to the Government, other regulatory bodies and those payments related to employees of SLT, have been made within the stipulated period.</p>
