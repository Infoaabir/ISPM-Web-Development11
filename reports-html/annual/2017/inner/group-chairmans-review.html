						  <p>The SLT Group has anticipated these transformations and strategically prepared ourselves to meet the challenges of the future, today.

It will enable the Group to become the most preferred digital lifestyle provider by the year 2022. The Group has implemented a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Operating Expenses (OPEX), and services plans and has identified other KPIs in the roadmap to Vision 2022. We have also set a digital services revenue target of 15% by 2022.</p>

The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable’s advanced 100Gbps technology will easily facilitate the quadrupling of bandwidth demand between Europe and Asia. We see our high capital expenditure as investments. With our state-of-the-art infrastructure - extensive optical network extending nearly 30,000 km, the link to the SMW 5, and the venturing into 5G, we have made great leaps in laying the ground work for the digital transformation outlined in Vision 2022.</p>

							<p>In 2017, SLT invested in targeted professional training for its employees and managers to ensure that they will be ready to face future changes in technology and market conditions and to improve our competitiveness in the sector.

						  <p>Access to telecommunications is critical to the development of all aspects of a nation’s economy including manufacturing, banking, education, agriculture, and Government. The synergy effect of the digital economy where information becomes more accessible and available makes communication a lot easier.</p>
							<p>As the nation’s telecommunication carrier, our Vision 2022 is aligned with the Government’s Digital Economy Strategy and other policies. The SLT Group has contributed immensely to the national economy and nation building. In 2017, we were able to contribute an impressive Rs. 38.58 billion in levies, taxes and license fees to the Government of Sri Lanka.</p>
							<p>Apart from our investments in bolstering the nation’s ICT infrastructure, we have served the nation through numerous initiatives. SLT was chosen as the communications provider for the eGovernment initiative: The Lanka Government Network (LGN 2.0). SLT has set up the LGN fibre optic network to cover 315 Government establishments. SLT will connect 860 Government institutions by the end of 2018.</p>
							<p>I am proud to state that Sri Lanka’s first purpose-built, Tier III data centre is now in operation at Pitipana. It is named as the “national data centre”, since it provides secure, reliable data hosting facilities, and cloud services to all Sri Lankans.</p>
							<p>To celebrate our 160th year anniversary, SLT implemented the “160 School Development Programme”. The project&apos;s focus was to provide ICT infrastructure: broadband connection with 12-month rental free with a free Wi-Fi router. By providing access to ICT to school children, we serve the nation and the future of our nation.</p>

This throughput was further improved up to 999.9 Mbps at subsequent field tests. SLT Mobitel was also the first to initiate the roll out of the 4.5G network to revolutionise the industry and to significantly enhance user experience for its valued customers. 4.5G will act as a bridge for the eventual adoption of the 5G standard, while bringing significant improvements to SLT and Mobitel’s existing 4G networks.</p>
							<p>In terms of the telco industry, growth will focus on broadband-related digital services. Broadband revenues will dominate the Income Statement within the next three years. Improvements of revenues from digital services will drive our Company for the next eight years and beyond, as technology unlocks unprecedented potential to build seamless digital ecosystems, reshaping the way we live, work, and interact.</p>
