		<h2>&#9;We offer an exciting suite of fixed ICT products and services</h2>
		<p>In our journey towards transforming into a digital service provider, SLT has brought a suite of exciting new products to its customers.</p>
		<h3>Broadband </h3>
		<p>SLT offers the highest monthly data volumes to customers, up to 3,000 GBs. We also possess the highest download speeds of up to 100 Mbps, and are equally capable of offering shared data for multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. The capacity of the ultra high speed National Backbone Network (NBN) was boosted with 100 G technology, aiming to cater the future needs of all ICT operators in the country.</p>
		<h4>Key initiatives undertaken during the year </h4>
		<h5>Volume enhancement</h5>
		<p>SLT increased the data volume of all its offered packages up to 75%. SLT introduced off-peak data volumes for the first time in 2011 as a free offer in addition to standard monthly data volume and maintained annual data volume enhancement continuously.</p>
		<h5>Speed and data volume enhancement</h5>
		<p>We continually enhanced the broadband speed of all packages powered by fibre, ADSL and LTE technologies. This enabled us to offer packages with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps. The enhancing of broadband volume is effectuated annually by improving the offered packages.</p>
		<h5>On demand data</h5>
		<p>This feature enables customers to add extra gigabytes of data to their existing package. They can do so online through the SLT broadband value-added services portal and via self-dialling IVR 0112 121212.</p>
		<h5>SLT Fibre</h5>
		<p>Fibre to the home (FTTH) services were expanded across all main cities and suburb areas under this feature to raise Internet speeds up to 100 Mbps.</p>
		<h3>Value added services </h3>
		<h4>SLT Filmhall – OTT entertainment platform  </h4>
		<p>SLT Filmhall offers unparalleled access to Hollywood, Bollywood, Sinhala, Tamil and Telugu movies. Customers can view all of the above and much more from the comfort of their own homes. SLT brings a veritable cinematic experience right to customers’ fingertips. The service can be accessed through SLT broadband as well as mobile devices through the related application.</p>
		<h3>SLT digisolutions </h3>
		<p>SLT aims to transform homes and offices into smart premises. Broadband, Wi-Fi, and PEO TV connections can be extended through the premises through internal wiring and powerline adapters. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology will further connect enabled devices anywhere on the premises to the resulting Wi-Fi network.</p>
		<h3>PEO TV – Impacting people&apos;s lifestyles </h3>
		<p>Our PEO TV platform is the ultimate provider of local and global content. We have revolutionised the traditional TV experience with a suite of features to include high quality digital imaging, time-shift TV, rewind TV, video on demand, and so much more.</p>
		<h4>PEO TV on the go through SLT Mobitel </h4>
		<p>The PEO TV platform has now been extended to our SLT Mobitel customers.</p>
		<h4>Multiple PEO TV offers at one location </h4>
		<p>Smartline (fibre optic) connections provide customers the unique possibility of having multiple PEO TV connections via a single connection. Thus individuals can fully personalise their content of choice.</p>
		<h3>Carrier-grade Wi-Fi </h3>
		<p>We are rolling out carrier-grade Wi-Fi technology in the nation. This will permit customers to access social media content, rich media content, and data-intensive enterprise applications on the go; a feature that was previously inaccessible on standard public Wi-Fi. This will provide unique retail experiences such as interactive shopping and business users will be able to conduct more efficient transactions without any disruptions during periods of travel.</p>

Our services are tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs of all sizes with powerful capabilities in convergence, extended reliability, improved scalability, and much more.</p>
		<h3>Akaza </h3>
		<p>Our drive towards a digital tomorrow is facilitated by the introduction of Akaza, Sri Lanka’s premier automated cloud computing platform. It provides end-to-end cloud computing services to enterprises to guarantee the maximum possible ROI. Akaza’s technology integrates all of its cloud services inclusive of Iaas, PaaS, DaaS, SaaS, and CaaS with the business management platform of corporate enterprises. Effectively, a gamut of services ranging from infrastructure to software can be accessed by way of a self-service catalogue online, centralising user management.</p>
		<p>Our cloud is hosted locally within our data centre. Users can access, store and utilise data through remote means using public internet, a secured internet protocol (IP) address or a virtual private network (VPN). This national cloud system will lead to a range of benefits for the national economy, such as by minimising an outflow of foreign currency, reducing the consumption of paper, and increasing the eco-friendliness of everyday business operations. It will further contribute to the development of an ICT-reinforced “Smart” Sri Lanka, and could extend its reach to global audiences as well.</p>
		<p>Further information about this exciting feature can be found on our corporate website.</p>

		<h2>  Our mobile ICT products and services</h2>

Furthermore, SLT Mobitel was awarded the “Fastest Mobile Network in Sri Lanka” by Ookla Speedtest.

		<h2>  We provide a superior customer experience by engaging with our customers in real time </h2>
		<p>At SLT, we have recognised the importance of providing an overall customer experience. The customers’ opinion of SLT is influenced by everything we do from responding to a complaint, fixing a fault, greeting a customer at an SLT Teleshop to marketing new products, or fulfilling a contract. The total customer experience matters. Especially with our strategic direction to create synergy within our Group to present one face to the customer, it is of paramount importance that the Group works together, in all our business lines, to cater to the needs of the customer and enhance the overall customer experience. Our substantial investments over the past few years, have emphasised our willingness to offer to our customers a superior network and customer service levels, supported by a very wide range of mobile and fixed products. We are sensitive to the voice of the customers and provide feedback and service in real time.</p>
		<p>In a highly competitive industry, we have to be extra mindful of the needs of the customers. Our customers want a consistent, responsive, reliable service and a telecom provider that offers a great experience and products that improve their lives. SLT Group has made great progress in these areas and we are committed to continue delivering superior customer service in the future.</p>
		<h3>Information on products and services are provided through multiple channels </h3>
		<p>We engage with customers through diversified means to provide accurate and relevant information on our products and services. They include: one on one interactions, our Contact Centre, SLT’s corporate website and social media accounts, mailers and newsletters, brochures, our customer satisfaction survey, ICT workshops, enterprise customer forums, and customer visits and meetings. Traditional media channels are also used to market and advertise our products and services to the general public.</p>
		<p>We have established a distinct hotline, 1212, for customers to obtain information and log concerns. This is a 24-hour service with zero cost to the customer. Any resulting user comments are entered into our operational support system (OSS). This helps us in refining our services as appropriate for further improvements in customer care.</p>
		<h3>Contact Centre </h3>
		<p>Our Contact Centre recorded a total of over 12 million calls in 2017; of which circa 8 million were to agents. A customer satisfaction rate of 90% was recorded throughout the year; we were also able to fulfil the service level KPIs established by the Government Information Centre, GIC (1919) and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) in this domain. (GIC and SLIC have outsourced their contact centre operation to SLT Contact Centre).</p>
		<p>Our Contact Centre launched the “Knowledge Hub”, as a tool to facilitate Contact Centre officers in answering calls. There was improvement in quality monitoring and call quality throughout the year. Call quality has improved by 2.39% YoY, from 87.65% in 2016 to 90.04% in 2017. Our Contact Centre also recorded a 100% availability with zero down time over the year. </p>
		<p><img src="../../images/Contact_Centre_Staff_recognized_1.jpg" class="img-responsive" /></p>
		<h3>There is a stringent process in place to manage complaints </h3>
		<p>Effective management of customer complaints and providing resolutions is a vital part which contributes to the overall customer experience. We have a stringent process in dealing with all complaints. Any complaint received by the contact centre and enterprise help desk are entered to the OSS, and forwarded to the corresponding work group. A trouble report will remain in the system unless it is attended to and the matter resolved. The officer in charge of the work group oversees the system and organises resources to address the issue. The officers are themselves monitored by deputy general managers.</p>
		<p>Our account managers frequently visit our enterprise customers to ensure that they are receiving all the support they require from SLT. Enterprise customers are equally furnished with the contact details of senior staff to escalate any issues to attention resulting from any discordances in expected service levels.</p>
		<p>The Plant Maintenance and Customer Service (PM and CS) Unit conducts an age analysis of existing trouble reports and conveys results to relevant senior officers. Samples of closed trouble reports are selected, and relevant feedback is obtained from the customers who lodged the initial, corresponding complaint. Further steps are taken if the customer is not satisfied.</p>
		<h3>Customer experience is the key differentiator </h3>
		<p>Our customer loyalty depends on customer satisfaction. We maintain a superior customer experience in order to keep our customers happy. SLT Group has realised that offering a superior customer service is an integral part of the digital transformation and Vision 2022. For the past few years, SLT has conducted a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) studies to identify and measure the key expectations of customers, evaluate the level of satisfaction across all touch points, and to identify any other issues. Currently we are practicing Ron Kaufman Service Architecture model to deliver superior customer service to our valued customers.</p>
		<p>This year too, SLT conducted a customer satisfaction study conducted by a reputed market research agency to maintain objectivity, high standards, quality assurance, and data accuracy. The sample size of 2,500 is a representation of all customer segments (SME, Consumer, Enterprise), business verticals, and geographical areas. A face-to-face interview, lasting about 45 minutes, were followed by an extensive questionnaire. The findings were shared among all the stakeholders of the company and awareness sessions were conducted internally to make our team aware of the principal pain points of our customers. The progress on the customer pain points were further reviewed internally at the Customer Experience Management (CEM) Forum chaired by the GCEO.</p>
