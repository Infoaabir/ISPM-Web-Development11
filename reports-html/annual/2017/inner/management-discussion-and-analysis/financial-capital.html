<h1>Financial capital </h1>
		
			<p><strong class="txtBlue">Financial capital is the legal ownership of all physical capital, as well as the monetary value of any asset that could be liquidated. Financial capital works in tandem with the other capitals to create value over the short, medium, and long-term for the Company as well as our stakeholders. This section is an overview of SLT Group’s operating performance, providing a commentary on how revenue and the adjusted EBITDA performance of the Group and its operating segments fared in 2018. The information presented below is duly supplemented with the Financial Statements and Notes. </strong></p>
			<h2>  Profitability</h2>
			<h3>Revenue </h3>
			<p>The revenue of the Group increased year on year (YoY) by 2.6%, to record a figure of Rs. 75.7 billion. SLT, as a company, recorded a revenue of Rs. 44.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.3% from the preceding year. The revenue growth was impacted by the increased taxes imposed by the Government. </p>
			<p>Our subsidiary company, SLT Mobitel, reported a marginal growth of 2%, to demonstrate a revenue of Rs. 36.5 billion in 2017 from Rs. 35.9 billion in 2016.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/134.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h3>Expenditure </h3>
			<p>The operating costs of the Group increased by 1.6% to Rs. 54.5 billion. The operating costs of SLT decreased from Rs. 33.2 billion to Rs. 33.1 billion which was a drop of 1%. This was a clear indication that SLT had managed its costs well.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/136.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h3>Profits </h3>
			<p>The Group recorded a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs. 5.5 billion for the financial year 2017. This was a YoY decrease of 8.5%, when compared with the figure of Rs. 6.5 billion recorded in 2016. The PBT was impacted by higher depreciation where the charge was Rs. 1 billion above 2016. The reason for the higher depreciation was due to the higher capital expenditure which was incurred by the Company during the last three years in order to build capacity and investments in new products.</p>
			<p>The profit after tax (PAT) of the Group was recorded at Rs. 3.9 billion. When compared with the corresponding figure for the preceding year of Rs. 4.8 billion, this represented a YoY decrease of 17.7%. The drop in profitability was due to the increased depreciation.</p>
			<p>At Company level, the PBT and PAT of SLT declined to Rs. 2.1 billion and Rs. 1.4 billion respectively due to the increased depreciation.</p>
			<p>SLT Mobitel recorded a PAT of Rs. 3.3 billion in 2017, compared to Rs.  4.1billion recorded in the preceding year.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/138.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/139.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<p>The Group EBITDA improved to Rs. 21.2 billion from Rs. 20.1 billion which was an increase of 5.4%. The Company EBITDA increased to Rs. 11.4 billion from Rs. 9.9 billion an increase of 14.9%.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/140.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h3>Return on equity </h3>
			<p>The return on equity (RoE) measures the profit attributable to shareholders as a percentage of their equity. The RoE in 2017 stood at 5.5% from 6.9% in 2016. For SLT as a Company, the ROE was 2.4% for 2017 and 2.9% in 2016. The main reason for the drop in the ROE was due to the increased depreciation and the increase in the asset base.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/142.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h3>Interest cover  </h3>
			<p>The Group interest cover was at 2.02 times in 2017, compared to 4.3 times in 2016. For SLT, this was .8 times in 2017; contrasted with 2.1 times in 2016. The Company&apos;s borrowings increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher capital expenditure. The fall in profitability due to increased depreciation also had an adverse impact.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/144.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h2>  Gearing</h2>
			<p>The gearing ratio measures the proportion of a company’s borrowed funds to its equity. For the Group this ratio was 0.37 in 2017, compared to 0.32 in 2016. At the Company level, it was 0.40 in 2017; an increase from 0.33 in 2016. The main reason for the increased gearing was due to the increase in the borrowings in order to fund capital expenditure.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/146.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h2>  Assets</h2>
			<h3>Non-current assets </h3>
			<p>The total non-current assets of the Group were Rs. 128.16 billion as at 31 December 2017. This was an increase of 11.0% from the figure of Rs. 115.45 billion recorded at the end of 2016. For SLT as a company, the total non-current assets were recorded at Rs. 109.88 billion, from Rs. 99.64 billion recorded in 2016; which represents an increase of 10.3%.</p>
			<h3>Property, plant, and equipment </h3>
			<p>The property, plant, and equipment of the Group increased to Rs. 117.0 billion in 2017, from Rs. 108.6 billion in 2016. This represented an increase of 7.7% at an increase of Rs. 8.4 billion. Of this figure, SLT accounted for Rs. 91.45 billion, compared to Rs. 81.5 billion recorded in 2016, representing an increase of 12.1%.</p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/150.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<p class="chartimg"><img src="../../images/151.png" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			<h2>  Segmental performance</h2>
			<p>The operations of the SLT Group are broken down into fixed ICT operations (the responsibility of SLT) and mobile ICT operations (which is overseen by Mobitel).</p>

			<p>This will be South Asia’s first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot in Galle port which will be operated and managed by SLT. </p>
			<p>SLT will operate the cable depot in Sri Lanka as a Joint Venture, “Galle Submarine Cable Depot Private Limited” (GSCDPL) with IOCPL (Indian Ocean Cableship Pte Limited) which is a ship service provider for SEAIOCMA (South East Asia &amp; Indian Ocean Cable Maintenance Agreement). IOCPL is a Joint Venture Company of Singtel Singapore and Orange France. Newly formed GSCDPL will be a depot service provider under the SEAIOCMA from 1 January 2018 onwards. </p>
			<p>SEAIOCMA is the international consortium for maintaining the undersea cables. Sri Lanka is an important destination where multiple cable systems are already in operation passing the country. Sri Lanka will be the only Submarine Cable Depot in the South Asian region. SEAIOCMA is an agreement among the telecom submarine cable operators, cable ship operators and cable depot operators for providing submarine cable maintenance spanning the area between Djibouti in the west, Perth in the South, Guam in the East and the northern tip of Taiwan. Prior to this initiative, Singapore was overlooking the Submarine Cable Depot to facilitate international cable systems. Through this operation in the South Asian region, SLT believes in the possibility of bringing in foreign currency to strengthen the country’s economy in the future.</p>
			<p>Galle Port has been selected to set up a submarine cable depot by the cable consortium with the participation of a number of countries and Sri Lanka will facilitate the cable maintenance ship berth and warehouse facility.</p>

	<h3>SLT Property Management (Private) Limited </h3>
			<p>Management of SLT’s real estate resources. SLTPM was floated in 2013 with the aim of developing the large number of unutilised/underutilised properties under SLT’s ownership. Given the growing demand for property in Sri Lanka, it was strongly felt that such idle lands could ideally be channeled towards more lucrative avenues that would not only enhance the value of the property, but also have a positive impact on the SLT Group bottom line. </p>
