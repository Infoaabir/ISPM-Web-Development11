                <h3>(e)  Use of estimates and judgements </h3>
                <p>The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
                <p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. </p>
                <p>Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is included in the following Notes: </p>

                <h2>3.  Significant accounting policies</h2>
                <p>The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in Financial Statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group entities.</p>
                <p>Where applicable, except the following:</p>
                <h3>(a)  Basis of consolidation </h3>
                <h4>(i)  Business combinations </h4>
                <p>The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.</p>
                <p>The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.</p>
                <p>Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
                <h4>(ii)  Subsidiaries </h4>
                <p>Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.</p>
                <h5>(ii-a)  Critical judgements in applying the entity’s </h5>
                <h5>accounting policies </h5>
                <p>The Directors have concluded that the Group controls all subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-b), below:</p>
                <h5>(ii-b) Interest in subsidiaries </h5>
                <p>Set out below are the Group’s subsidiaries as at 31 December <span class="highlight">2017</span>:&#9;</p>

                <h4>(iii)  Non-controlling interest (NCI) </h4>
                <p>NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.</p>
                <h4>(iv)  Loss of control </h4>
                <p>When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit </p>

                <p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.</p>
                <h3>(c)  Financial instruments </h3>

                <p>The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.</p>
                <h4>(i)  Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities – Recognition and derecognition </h4>
                <p>The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date.</p>
                <p>The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.</p>
                <p>The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.</p>
                <p>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</p>

                <p>Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>
                <h5>(i-iii)  Fair value measurement </h5>
                <p>SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell and an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
                <p>A fair value measurement requires an entity to determine the following:</p>
                <ol class="list list-123">
                  <li>The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement. </li>
                  <li>For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and best use). </li>
                  <li>The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. </li>
                  <li>The valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorised. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).</p>
                <p>When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out. </p>
                <h6>Determination of fair values</h6>
                <p>The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other risks affecting the specific instrument.</p>
                <ul class="list list-disc">
                  <li><strong>Level 1 <br>
                  </strong>Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; </li>
                  <li><strong>Level 2</strong> <br>
                    Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and</li>

                <h6>Amortised cost </h6>
                <p>The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.</p>
                <h5>(i-iv)  Reclassifications </h5>
                <p>Reclassifications of financial assets, other than as set out below or of financial liabilities between measurement categories are not permitted following initial recognition.</p>
                <p>Held-for-trading non-derivative financial assets are transferred out of the held at fair value through profit or loss category in the following circumstances: to the available-for-sale category, where, in rare circumstances, they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term; or to the loan and receivables category, where they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term and they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
                <p>Financial assets are transferred out of the available-for-sale category to the loan and receivables category where they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
                <p>Held-to-maturity assets are reclassified to the available-for-sale category if the portfolio becomes tainted following the sale of other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets prior to their maturity.</p>
                <p>Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification. For financial assets reclassified out of the available-for-sale category into loans and receivables, any gain or loss on those assets recognised in shareholders’ equity prior to the date of reclassification is amortised to the profit or loss over the remaining life of the financial asset, using the effective interest method.</p>
                <h5>(i-v)  Impairment </h5>
                <h6>Non-derivative financial assets </h6>
                <p>Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
                <p>Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes –</p>
                <ul class="list list-disc">
                  <li>default or delinquency by a debtor; </li>
                  <li>restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;</li>
                  <li>indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;</li>
                  <li>adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;</li>
                  <li>the disappearance of an active market for a security; or</li>
                  <li>observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.</p>

                      <td> The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment. Those found not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet individually identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics. In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. </td>

                        If the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security subsequently increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss is reversed through Statement of Profit or Loss; otherwise, it is reversed through OCI. </td>

                <h6>Non-financial assets </h6>
                <p>At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than, investment property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.</p>
                <p>For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.</p>
                <p>Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.</p>
                <p>The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.</p>
                <p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
                <p>Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in CGU on pro rata-basis.</p>
                <p>An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>
                <h3>(d)  Property, plant and equipment </h3>
                <h4>(i)  Recognition and measurement </h4>
                <p>Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>
                <p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. </p>
                <p>Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that asset.</p>
                <p>When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.</p>
                <h4>(ii)  Subsequent costs </h4>
                <p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
                <h4>(iii)  Depreciation </h4>
                <p>Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition, depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. </p>
                <p>Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: </p>

                <p>Capital work in progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.</p>
                <p>Major spare parts and project-related inventory qualify as property, plant and equipment when the entity expects to use them during more than one period and are used in connection with specific items of property, plant and equipment.</p>
                <h4>(v)  Derecognition </h4>
                <p>The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within “other income” in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.</p>
                <p>When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.</p>
                <h4>(vi)  Borrowing cost </h4>
                <p>Borrowing cost directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as a part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.</p>

                <h4>(i)  Goodwill </h4>
                <p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.</p>
                <p>Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see Note 3 (a) (i).</p>
                <h5>Subsequent measurement </h5>
                <p>Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. </p>
                <h4>(ii)  Other intangible assets </h4>
                <p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. </p>
                <h4>(iii)  Licenses </h4>
                <p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as license fee and is being amortised over the license period on a straight line basis. </p>
                <h4>(iv)  Subsequent expenditure </h4>
                <p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally-generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. </p>
                <h4>(v)  Amortisation </h4>
                <p>Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:</p>

                <p>Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. </p>
                <p>For operating leases, the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position.</p>
                <h3>(g)  Inventories </h3>
                <p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle. Value of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. </p>
                <h3>(h)  Share capital </h3>
                <h4>Ordinary share capital </h4>
                <p>Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. </p>
                <h3>(i)  Government grants </h3>
                <p>Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.</p>
                <h3>(j)  Employee benefits </h3>
                <h4>(i)  Defined contribution plans </h4>
                <p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during services is rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. </p>
                <h5>Employees’ Provident Fund </h5>
                <p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
                <p>All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which the respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances. Employees of Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), where the Company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
                <h5>Employees’ Trust Fund </h5>
                <p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund. </p>
                <h4>(ii)  Defined benefit plans </h4>
                <p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method as recommended by LKAS 19 – “Employee Benefits”. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the reporting date and have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations. </p>
                <p>The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan in other comprehensive income.</p>
                <p>The present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the defined retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 26. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of defined benefit obligations. </p>
                <p>Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the first year of service for all employees, in conformity with LKAS 19 – “Employee Benefits”. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises only on completion of five years of continued service.</p>
                <h4>(iii)  Termination benefits </h4>
                <p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted,and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. </p>
                <h4>(iv)  Short-term benefits </h4>
                <p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.</p>
                <p>A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.</p>
                <h3>(k)  Trade and other payables </h3>
                <p>Trade and other payables are stated at their amortised cost.</p>
                <h3>(l)  Commitments and contingencies </h3>
                <p>All discernible risks are accounted for in determining the amount of all known liabilities. The Company’s share of any contingencies and capital commitments and of its subsidiaries for which the Company is also liable severally or otherwise are also included with appropriate disclosures. </p>
                <h3>(m)  Revenue </h3>
                <h4>(i)  Goods </h4>
                <p>Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. </p>
                <h5>Equipment sale </h5>
                <p>Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. </p>
                <p>If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised. The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue-generating activities (generally the sale of telecommunications equipment and ongoing service) is allocated to those components that are separable based on the estimated fair value of the components. </p>
                <p>The timing of the transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.</p>
                <h5>Sale of directories </h5>
                <p>Revenue from publication sales relating to advertising revenue is recognised on publishing the advertisement on the telephone directory and a copy delivered to the subscriber on a percentage of completion method.</p>
                <h4>(ii)  Services </h4>
                <p>Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. Revenue from service contracts that cover periods of greater than 12 months is recognised in the profit and loss in proportion to the services delivered at the reporting date. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service. </p>
                <h4>Domestic and international call revenue and rental income </h4>
                <h5>Fixed line </h5>
                <p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation to the period of services rendered.</p>
                <h5>Mobile revenue </h5>
                <p>Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the provision of other mobile telecommunications services.

                <p>Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. </p>
                <p>Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.</p>

An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.</p>
                <h3>(p)  Finance income and expenses </h3>
                <p>The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:</p>
                <ul class="list list-disc">

                <h3>(q)  Income tax </h3>
                <p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income. </p>
                <h4>(i)  Current taxation </h4>
                <p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised or profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>

                <h4>(ii)  Deferred taxation </h4>
                <p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments in nor taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets liabilities will be realised simultaneously.</p>
                <p>A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries as the Parent Company has control over the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>
                <p>No deferred taxation is provided for Mobitel (Private) Limited due to the fact that the income taxes are computed and paid at 2% on revenue.</p>
                <h4>(iii)  Economic Service Charge (ESC) </h4>
                <p>ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed payment can be carried forward and set-off against the income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.</p>
                <h4>(iv)  Sales tax </h4>
                <p>Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sale tax, except: where sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable.</p>
                <h3>(r)  Earnings per share </h3>
                <p>The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.</p>
                <p>Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</p>
                <h3>(s)  Insurance reserve </h3>
                <p>The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings an amount equal to 0.1% of additions to property, plant and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover any losses arising from damage to property, plant and equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured with a third-party insurer.</p>
                <h3>(t)  Dividend distribution </h3>
                <p>Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.</p>
                <p>Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the dividend recommended and declared by the Board of Directors, is approved by the shareholders.</p>
                <h3>(u)  Comparatives </h3>
                <p>Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in respect of the previous period. Where the presentation or classification of items in the Financial Statements are amended, comparative amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.</p>
                <h3>(v)  Statement of cash flow </h3>
                <p>The Cash Flow Statement has been prepared using the ‘indirect method’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard LKAS 07 – “Statement of Cash Flows”. Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. The cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, money at call and short notice.</p>
                <h3>(w)  Events after the reporting period </h3>
                <p>All material events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate, adjustments or disclosures have been made in respective Notes to the Financial Statements.</p>
                <h3>(x)  Directors’ Responsibility Statement </h3>
                <p>The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for these Financial Statements.</p>
                <h3>(y)&#9;Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements </h3>
                <p>In the preparation of these Financial Statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the following discussion addresses the Company&apos;s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its financial performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.</p>
                <h4>(i)  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment </h4>
                <p>The Company assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.</p>
                <p>Where the Company determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any change in an asset&apos;s life or residual value is reflected in the Company&apos;s Financial Statements when the change in estimate is determined.</p>
                <h4>(ii)&#9;Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets </h4>
                <p>The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following:</p>
                <ol class="list list-abc">
                  <li>obsolescence or physical damage; </li>
                  <li>significant changes in technology and regulatory environments; </li>
                  <li>significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; </li>
                  <li>significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable amount for assets or cash-generating units require significant judgement.</p>
                <h4>(iii)  Revenue recognition </h4>
                <p>Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.</p>
                <h4>(iv)  Valuation of receivables </h4>
                <p>The provision for impairment losses for trade and other receivables reflects the Company&apos;s estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of customers to make required payments. The provision is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer credit worthiness and the Company’s historical write-off experience etc. Changes to the provision may be required if the financial condition of its customers improves or deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs.</p>
                <h3>(z) New accounting standards issued but not</h3>
                <h3>effective as at reporting date </h3>
                <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has issued the following new Sri Lanka Accounting Standards which will become applicable for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has not assessed the potential impact on its Financial Statements resulting from their application.</p>
                <h4>SLFRS 9 – Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement</h4>
                <p>The objective of this SLFRS is to establish principles for the financial reporting of financial assets and liabilities that will present relevant and useful information to users of Financial Statements for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows. This standard will be effective for financial periods beginning on or after </p>
                <p>1 January 2018.</p>
                <h4>SLFRS 15 – Revenue from contract with customers</h4>
                <p>Establishes the principles that an entity shall apply report useful information to users of Financial Statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. This standard will be effective for financial period beginning on or after 1 January 2018. </p>
                <p>A preliminary evaluation of the existing contracts which are categorised as revenue of the Group has been performed in relation to the adoption of SLFRS 15. The Group is currently in the process of evaluating and quantifying the accounting impact, any impacts on the current systems and processes will be modified where necessary. The Group will reflect the cumulative impact of SLFRS 15 in equity on the date of adoption.</p>
                <h4>SLFRS 16 – Leases</h4>
                <p>SLFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring leases to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value even though lessor accounting remains similar to current practice. This supersedes: LKAS 17 – “Leases”, IFRIC 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 – “Operating Leases” –Incentives; and SIC 27 evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease. Earlier application is permitted for entities that apply SLFRS – 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.</p>
                <p>SLFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under LKAS 17.</p>
                <p>SLFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, but not before an entity applies SLFRS 15. A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. The standard’s transition provisions permit certain reliefs.</p>
                <p>The Group will continue to assess the potential effect of SLFRS 16 on its Consolidated Financial Statements and the impact on the implementation of the above standard has not been quantified yet.</p>
                <h2>4. Financial Risk Management</h2>
                <p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.</p>
                <p>The Group’s risk management processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group activities.</p>
                <p>The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management processes/guidelines and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal reviews of risk management controls and procedures. The results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.</p>
                <p>The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:</p>
                <ul class="list list-disc">
                  <li>Credit risk </li>
                  <li>Liquidity risk</li>
                  <li>Market risk </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This Note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these Financial Statements.</p>
                <h3>4.1  Credit risk </h3>
                <p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation, and arise principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.</p>
                <p>Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.</p>
                <h4>4.1.1  Trade receivables </h4>
                <p>The Group having a very well-established credit policy for both International Interconnect Customers and Domestic Customers to minimise the credit risk. A separate committee has been established to evaluate and recommend the credit worthiness for the International Interconnect Customer. Further, prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating credit risk.</p>
                <p>Domestic service is offered to a new customer only after scrutinising through a internal blacklisted data base. The Group has a well-established credit control policy and process to minimise the credit risk. Customers are categorised according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit limit will be periodically revised as per the past monthly bill value. High risk voice customers are subjected to auto disconnection when they reached the threshold limit. Credit control actions and recovery actions are taken for the overdue customers and defaulted customers to minimise the credit risk. High revenue-generated customers including corporate customers are monitored individually.</p>
                <p>As at 31 December 2017, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade by geographic region was as follows:</p>

                <h3>4.2  Liquidity risk </h3>
                <p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.</p>
                <p>The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis. </p>
                <p>Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury division.</p>
                <p>The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and discounted:</p>

                <p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. </p>

                <p>The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.</p>

                <h4>4.3.2  Interest rate risk </h4>
                <p>Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>
                <p>To minimise the adverse impact of variable interest rate borrowings due to an upward movement of USD interest rates in the market, the Company has obtained an interest rate SWAP and arrangements are being made to obtain an interest rate CAP.</p>
                <p>Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.</p>
                <p>Interest rate sensitivity of the Company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below:</p>

                <h2>5.  Operating segments &#9;&#9;</h2>
                <p>The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker – CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:</p>
                <ul class="list list-disc">
                  <li>Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services. </li>
                  <li>Mobile ICT operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.</li>
                  <li>Other segment operations includes Directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2017 or 2016. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured  based on segment profit before tax. As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.</p>

                <p>In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri Lanka, based on international call minutes terminated in the country. This levy was made effective from 3 March 2003, where initially the levy was defined in such a way that operators were allowed to claim the 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges. </p>
                <p>The TDC refund received in 2014 corresponds to the period from April 2009 to July 2010 which was the last claim obtained under the respective regulation. As the said regulation was received with effect from July 2010 while eliminating the reimbursement process, the final claim requested from TRC applicable for the above period was received on year 2014. </p>
                <p>First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July 2010 with an International Telecommunication Operators Levy (ITOL) TDC rate change from USD cents 3.80 to USD cents 1.50. Through the same revision, the disbursement process of TDC was removed from the regulation. As stated above the revised ITOL rate prevailed until such time the rate was revised to USD cents 3.00 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012 and ITOL rate was further revised again to USD cents 6.00 per minute with effect from January 2016 in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2016.</p>
                <p>Mobitel (Private) Limited Recognises Telecommunications Development Charge (TDC) in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 10 years, as disclosed in Note 34. </p>

                  <li>On 1 September 1991, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) transferred its entire telecommunications business and related assets and liabilities to SLT. A valuation of the assets and liabilities transferred to SLT was performed by the Government of Sri Lanka. The net amount of those assets and liabilities represents SLT’s Contributed Capital on incorporation and the value of property, plant and equipment as determined by the Government of Sri Lanka. Valuers were used to determine the opening cost of fixed assets on 1 September 1991 in the first statutory accounts of SLT. Further, SLT was converted into a public limited company, Sri Lanka Telecom Limited (SLTL), on 25 September 1996 and on that date, all business and the related assets and liabilities of SLT were transferred to SLTL as part of the privatisation process. </li>
                  <li>The cost of fully-depreciated assets still in use in the Company as at 31 December 2017 was Rs. 69,661 million (2016 – Rs. 58,346 million). The cost of fully-depreciated assets still in use in the Group as at 31 December 2017 was Rs. 78,715 million (2016 – Rs. 64,027 million). </li>

                  <li>The Directors believe, pertaining to lands and buildings which were vested from the corporation to the Company, that the Company has freehold title to land and buildings transferred at incorporation of the Company (to take over the assets and liabilities of the Corporation at the Conversion of SLT into a public limited company on 25 September 1996), by operation of law, although no specific title documents are available for each of such lands. The Company has initiated a process to obtain a title document from the Government authorities, in order to confirm the list of lands so vested with the Company.</li>
                  <li>All the motor vehicles have been insured. An insurance reserve has been created together with a sinking fund investment to meet any potential losses with regard to uninsured property, plant and equipment. At the reporting date, the insurance reserve amounted to Rs. 691 million (2016 – Rs. 680 million) (Note 27). Further, all the motor vehicles have been insured.</li>
                  <li>Impairment of assets of Group consist of the carrying value of Next Generation Network (NGN) Rs. 28 million (2016 – 83 million), PSTN CPE Rs. 18 million (2016 – Nil), Cable NetWork Beyond DP Rs. 44 million (2016 – Nil) and National Transmission Equipment 10 million (2016-Nil) were impaired due to the flood. Impairment provision for pay phones Rs. Nil (2016 – 9 million) and IPTV CPE Rs. Nil (2016 – Rs. 44 million). </li>
                  <li> The Company capitalised borrowing costs amounting to Rs. 2,650 million during the year (2016 – Rs. 1,239 million). Borrowing cost capitalised from a Group perspective amounted to Rs. 2,650 million (2016 – Rs. 1,239 million).</li>

<p>In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial valuation. In 2017, 1967/70 Mortality Table issued by the Institute of Actuaries (2016 – 1967/70 Mortality Table) was taken as the base for the valuation.</p>
<p>The provisions for defined obligations of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, SLT Human Capital Solution (Private) Limited, SLT Digital Services (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) Limited and Mobitel (Private) Limited are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S Goonetilleke and Associates respectively. The employee benefit liability of all other companies in the Group are based on gratuity formula.</p>
<p>The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded. </p>
Sensitivity analysis
<p>Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions consultant,  would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amount shown below.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Financial Position is the effect of the assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted in the given table.</p>
