            Lanka Telecom is at the cutting edge of telecommunications in this 
            country. In six years it has taken a moribund state entity and transformed 
            it into a dynamic and innovative communications provider, on par with 
            the world&#8217;s best. Sri Lanka&#8217;s move towards a fully liberalised 
            telecommunications market will enable SLT to use the opportunity to 
            grow and to provide state-of-the-art services making the country a 
            telecommunications hub for the South Asian region.<br />
            <br />
            </span><span class="subheding">Robust</span><span class="text"> SLT 
            has close to 90% of the fixed line subscriber customer base. Its acquisition 
            of Mobitel, Sri Lanka&#8217;s third largest mobile operator makes 
            it the only provider to offer both fixed and mobile services. Mobitel 
            will soon offer a state-of-the-art GSM network with the capacity for 
            third generation mobile telephony services.<br />
            <br />
            The recent re-commissioning of the microwave link between India and 
            Sri Lanka gives SLT access to a potential Indian customer base of 
            43 million. The Telecom City that would combine the best in information 
            technology with the finest in communications technology will enable 
            SLT to offer better connectivity and higher bandwidth to those companies 
            who wish to exploit this. High speed internet access through SLT Broadband, 
            Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and an Internet Data Centre to host 
            and manage data for business customers are some of the Company&#8217;s 
            recent products and services.<br />

            In 2002 it offered 12% of its shares to the public and as a result 
            became the largest public quoted company on the Colombo Stock Exchange. 
            Its annual turnover now exceeds Rs. 24 billion and for the last two 
            years it achieved operating profits of over Rs. 5 billion. Over the 
            past six years Rs. 51.25 billion has been invested to upgrade its 
            infrastructure and network and a further Rs. 7.0 billion has been 
            earmarked for 2004.</span> </td>
