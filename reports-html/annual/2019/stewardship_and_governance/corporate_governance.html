<p>Strong corporate governance facilitates effective management and monitoring of operations of an organisations and helps to ensure that Directors fulfil their responsibilities towards their stakeholders – including shareholders, customers, employees, and the community. The Board of Directors of SLT has adopted guidelines that define fiduciary duties and expected standard of conduct. The Board has also adopted corporate governance guidelines that reflect the Board’s current governance practices and the Board’s commitment to ensuring its effectiveness. </p>
			<p>SLT is in full compliance with the following frameworks of legislation, codes and voluntary practices as part of its corporate governance guidelines adopted by the Board of Directors;</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Internal Company rules and processes and industry codes of practice and corporate ethics </li>
				<li>Articles of Association (“AoA”) of the Company</li>
				<li>Legislation, particularly the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No. 27 of 1996</li>

			<p><img src="../images/governance_structure.jpg"  class="img-responsive" alt="" /></p>
			
			<h2>The Board of Directors</h2>
			<h3>Composition of the Board</h3>
			<p>The Board of Directors during the year 2019 comprised eight Non-Executive Directors; a majority of whom are independent as the Board deems appropriate to function efficiently as a body, subject to the Company’s Articles of Association.</p>
			<p>Their biographies on pages 78 and 80 of the annual report demonstrate a breadth of experience, understanding of business and sufficient calibre to provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources, and standards of conduct which is vital to the Group. </p>
			<h3>Selection of Directors</h3>
			<p>In terms of the Articles of Association of SLT, the Board of Directors has the authority to fill vacancies in the Board and appoint additional Directors subject to their re-election at the next Annual General Meeting and to nominate candidates for election by the shareholders. Accordingly, two major shareholders, namely the Government of Sri Lanka acting through the Secretary to the Treasury, and Global Telecommunication Holdings N.V. recommend five and four Directors to the Board respectively. The Board appoints them to the Board, filling casual vacancies as provided by the AoA after deliberation of their experience, understanding of business and financial issues, ability to exercise sound judgement, diversity, leadership, and achievements and experience in matters affecting business and industry.</p>
			<h3>The role of the Board</h3>
			<h4>Providing strategic leadership</h4>
			<p>The Board is the highest decision-making body of the Company who provides strategic leadership to the Management. The Company’s business is managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board delegates the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company, and through that individual to other Senior Management, the authority and responsibility for managing the Company’s business. The Board’s role is to oversee the management and governance of the Company and to monitor Senior Management’s performance. </p>
			<p>The Board is accountable to shareholders for ensuring that SLT is appropriately managed and achieves the strategic objectives it sets. </p>
			<p>Among the Board’s core responsibilities are to:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Select, monitor, evaluate and compensate Senior Management. </li>
				<li>Assure that management succession planning is adequate.</li>
				<li>Review and approve significant corporate actions.</li>
				<li>Review and monitor implementation of Management’s strategic plans.</li>
				<li>Review and approve the Company’s annual business plan, budgets and operating plan </li>
				<li>Monitor corporate performance and evaluate results compared to the strategic plans and other long-range goals.</li>
				<li>Review Company’s financial controls and reporting systems.</li>
				<li>Review and approve the Company’s financial statements and financial reporting.</li>
				<li>Review the Company’s legal compliance programmes and procedures</li>
				<li>Oversee the Company’s management of enterprise risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following processes are in place in order to provide timely and accurate information to Directors to perform their responsibilities;</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>All Directors receive accurate, relevant, timely, clear and balanced information.</li>
				<li>The Company Secretary act as the point of contact for the flow of information between Committees, the Board of Directors, and other key managers</li>
				<li>The CEO along with the respective Chief Officers and the Heads of Divisions presents their submissions to the Board and provides the necessary clarifications requested by the Board.</li>
				<li>In addition, all Board Papers are made available in electronic format, in line with the Group’s sustainability initiatives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The attendance of individual Directors at Board meetings and Committee meetings during the year is set out in the table below.</p>

The Chairman of the Board of SLT is a non-executive appointment and focusses on strategic issues and monitoring the business and executive team. He ensures Board procedures are followed and all Board members effectively participate during meetings.</p>
			<p>The CEO is responsible for day-to-day management of the business and leadership of the executive team, and execution of the Group’s strategic and operating plans. The Chairman meets the CEO regularly to discuss any issues pertaining to the Company’s performance, operational matters, and human resources.</p>
			<h3>CEO Performance Evaluation</h3>
			<p>At the beginning of each year, the CEO presents his performance objectives for the upcoming year to the Board of Directors for their approval. At the end of the year, the Board meet to discuss the CEO’s performance for the current year against his performance objectives. The Board of Directors and the CEO then meet to review the CEO’s performance evaluation and compensation.</p>
			<h3>The Company Secretary </h3>
			<p>The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board and is available to individual Directors in respect of Board procedures.</p>
			<p>The Company Secretary supports the Chairman in delivery of the agenda, in particular the planning of the annual cycle of Board and Board committee meetings, and ensures that information is made available to Board members in a timely fashion. He also advises the Directors on Board procedures and corporate governance matters.</p>
			<p>He is Secretary to all the Board subcommittees as well. The Company Secretary is an Attorney-at-Law and an Associate member of The Chartered Governance Institute, United Kingdom.</p>
			<p>The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.</p>
			<h3>Internal control and risk management </h3>
			<p>Internal control framework currently in place is set by the risk management framework, financial control, internal audit and supporting policies. The aim of SLT’s internal control framework is to assure that operations are effective and well aligned with the strategic goals. The internal control framework is intended to ensure correct, reliable complete and timely financial reporting and management information. The framework endorses ethical values, good corporate governance and risk management practices.</p>
			<p>SLT uses systematic risk management to develop the efficiency and control of business operations as well as their profitability and continuity. </p>
			<h3>Strategic Governance Boards (“SGB”)</h3>
			<p>Strategic Governance Board comprising the CEO and the Chief Officers of each functional area are given the responsibility of studying the requirements of cross functional areas and introducing solutions in a transparent manner. </p>
			<p>The six cross functional governance boards previously introduced have reduced to four in an attempt to improve capital investment decisions, enhance supply chain management and better utilisation of Group resources.</p>
			<h3>Corporate Ethics</h3>
			<p>SLT has adopted a Code of Ethics for Directors and a more detailed Code of Conduct for the employees, which extended to third parties who deal with the Company. The Code sets out principles to guide employees in carrying out their duties and responsibilities to the highest standards of personal and corporate integrity when dealing with SLT, its competitors, customers, suppliers, and the community. Processes and standards in the Code are intended to enhance investor confidence and rapport, and to ensure that decision-making is properly carried out in the best interests of the Group. The Code covers areas such as equal opportunity employment practices, workplace health and safety, conduct in the workplace, business conduct, protection of SLT’s assets, proprietary information and intellectual property, data protection, security, resilience, conflict of interest, and non-solicitation of customers and employees. The Code is posted on SLT’s internal website. Policies and standards are clearly stipulated to guide employees in carrying out their daily tasks. </p>
			<h3>Material Contracts</h3>
			<p>There are no material contracts entered into by SLT or any of its subsidiaries that involve the interests of the CEO, any Director, or the controlling shareholders, Secretary to the Treasury and the Global Telecommunications Holdings, N.V.</p>
			<h3>Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors</h3>
			<p>The R &amp; NC reviews and proposes the Non-Executive Directors’ fees based on experience and skills of the Directors and the complexity of the Group’s business and operations, for the approval of the Board.</p>
			<p>The fees for Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman comprised a fee for attendance at Board and Board’s subcommittee meetings. The cost of travelling and accommodation incurred by the overseas Directors who were required to travel out of their country to attend Board and subcommittee meetings is reimbursed.</p>
			<p>The aggregate Directors’ fees paid to Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 was LKR 18.0 Mn.</p>
			<p>Mr W K H Wegapitiya, who was appointed to the Board in December 2015 has declined to accept a Director fee and offered his monthly Director fee to a charitable organisation.</p>
			<h3>Remuneration of Senior Management</h3>
			<p>The remuneration framework and policy is designed to support implementation of the Group’s strategy and enhance shareholder value.</p>
			<p>The following are the principles for remuneration to Senior Management:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Set and link appropriate corporate and individual performance metrics based on the medium and long-term targets to the remuneration for evaluation of performance to support business strategies </li>
				<li>Offer competitive packages to attract and retain highly experienced and talented individuals</li>
			</ul>
			<p>SLT’s CEO is the head of management and is, therefore, remunerated as part of Senior Management. The R &amp; NC recommends the salary package of the CEO to be commensurate with his qualifications and experience for the approval of the Board. The CEO’s performance is assessed against the key performance indicators agreed upon at the beginning of each year and is compensated accordingly.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<h3>Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting </h3>
			<p>The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors, and all shareholders are encouraged to participate. Chairpersons of subcommittees will be available at the AGM to answer any questions from shareholders.</p>
			<h3>Major transactions</h3>
			<p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Companies Act, discloses to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2019. </p>
			<h3>Related party transactions</h3>
			<p>The Board of Directors has applied rules issued by the CSE on related party transactions throughout its decision-making process to avoid any conflicts of interest that may occur. The Board has recognised the importance of a Related Party Transactions Review Committee under the Board of Directors to enhance corporate transparency and promote fair transactions between SLT and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, a RPT- RC was formed comprising three Non-Executive Directors with the objective of ensuring that the interests of shareholders are taken into account when entering into RPTs.</p>
			<p>The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries as disclosed in <a href="#1" nid="32" class="cd-btn">Note 32</a> of the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, the Board believes those transactions are exempted in accordance with exceptions specified in the Code of Best Practices on Related Party Transactions issued by the SEC. All these are recurrent transactions and are in the ordinary course of business of the Company.</p>
			<h3>Statement of Compliance</h3>
			<p>SLT is fully compliant with the requirements stipulated in Section 7.10 on “Corporate Governance” of the Continuing Listing Requirements of the Colombo Stock Exchange issued in 2010 and subsequent amendments/guidelines thereto. See the tables on pages 95 to 99 for the rules on “Corporate Governance Principles” and the degree of compliance to the said rules.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Board of Directors to the best of their knowledge and belief is satisfied that all statutory payments due to the Government, other regulatory bodies and those payments related to employees of SLT, have been made in a timely manner.</p>
