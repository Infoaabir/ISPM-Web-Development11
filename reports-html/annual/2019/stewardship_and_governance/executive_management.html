			<p>Mr Seneviratne obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics from the University of Kent, UK and a Master&apos;s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Calgary, Canada. He pursued a career in telecommunications starting in 1982 at the then Sri Lanka Telecommunications Department (present day SLT).

			<p>In 1990 Mr Seneviratne accepted a position with Motorola Corporation and moved to Singapore on a regional role. During this period he developed Motorola’s relationship with SLT that enabled SLT to provide telephone service to remote areas including restoring telephone service to Jaffna in 1996.</p>
			<p>Since leaving Motorola, Mr Seneviratne has carried out several professional consulting assignments in telecommunications and renewable energy, while engaging in rural electrification activities during his spare time. He was part of a team that set up four grid connected mini hydropower systems.

			<p>An in depth understanding of technology and its continuous immersion into the lives of people everywhere, this is what gives Mr Kiththi Perera an edge in this now predominantly digital world. He possesses a passion for understanding the evolutionary nature of businesses and how best to support them with the solutions they need to sustain themselves as they grow. Currently, he sits at the helm of Sri Lanka Telecom’s decisive and pioneering shift into Fibre and draws from years of experience and expertise that has seen the Company grow year-on-year.</p>
			<p>Mr Perera believes in the power of contribution through collaboration. He understands that high-level products need multiple partners bringing the best of their creative intellect to the table in order to be successful. This thinking is a result of years he himself has spent working with some of the finest minds in engineering – a road that leads all the way back to the Engineering Council and the Institution of Engineering and Technology in the UK, of which he is a Chartered Engineer. Being a Masters Graduate from the University of Moratuwa in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering only solidifies the foundation of his career, which now spans a quarter of a century.</p>
			<p>Having been instrumental in the growing of several business segments from Government to Enterprise and SME, Mr Kiththi Perera now brings his attention to Consumer Businesses and Fibre connectivity, which he believes require the most amount of focus at this time. He is aware that the process requires as much an internal transformation as it does the external preparations. Creating meaningful and effective new products in the digital space for customers across all business segments is a priority, and the plan to go global is a firm eventuality on his watch.</p>
