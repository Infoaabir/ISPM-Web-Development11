			<h3>Customer Service Week 2019</h3>
			<p>SLT successfully conducted its second Customer Service Week (CSW) in parallel to the International Customer Service Week celebrated the world over between 7-11 October. The theme for 2019 was “You are our Pride” and the event was held with the aim of recognising and appreciating SLT’s loyal customers and employees who serve the Company’s customers.</p>
			<p>This year’s theme was a reflection on the importance placed by the Company on its customers and the employees who are committed to serving those customers on a daily basis, with emphasis on the fact that employees and customers together are what make up the true pride of SLT and are the true reason behind the Company’s continued success. A series of programmes and activities were held during CSW 2019 to pay tribute to customers and employees, including customer visits to identify any issues or areas of improvement, visits to employees in regional offices to recognise and appreciate their contribution to serving customers, and a special tech talk, “Geek Speekz”, held at the Hilton Colombo.</p>
			<p>Geek Speekz was organised to appreciate and thank SLT’s enterprise and Government sector customers. The event was a great success, with many corporates sharing their individual digital roadmaps that they have put in place to support the transformation of Sri Lanka into a digital economy.</p>
			<p>The CSW 2019 closing ceremony saw the highest participation, with 25 teams from SLT’s customer touchpoints being recognised and rewarded for their commitment and passion towards ensuring customer service excellence.</p>
			<h3>Customer Satisfaction Survey</h3>
			<p>In the year under review, SLT continued the practice of conducting a customer satisfaction survey. The services of a reputed research agency were obtained for this purpose which ensured that the survey was conducted with a high degree of professionalism. We can be assured of its objectivity, quality assurance the accuracy of data collection and the conclusions. Our Customer Satisfaction Index retained its previous 83% level, while the Net Promoter Score increased 2 points year-on-year to reach 40. A diverse and representative sample including all customer segments (SME, enterprise and consumer), business verticals and geographical areas was used for the survey, which gives further confidence in the accuracy of the results. The methodology used was a face-to-face 30-45 minute interview followed by a comprehensive questionnaire.</p>
			<h3>Customer voice survey</h3>
			<p>SLT regularly conducts a customer voice survey to better understand the sentiments of its customers towards the Company’s customer service. The survey provides insights on customer satisfaction on service delivery and fulfilment. During the period under review, SLT registered 93% overall satisfaction on the time taken to resolve customer complaints, with 85% of customer complaints attended to within the committed timeframe.</p>
			<h3>Mystery audit 2019</h3>
			<p>Mystery audits were conducted during the year at all branches across the island. The audit tested the performance of Regional Telecom Offices, Teleshops, and franchise branches across four dimensions:</p>
			1.&#9;Convenience of branch (exterior)
			2.&#9;Convenience of branch (interior)
			3.&#9;Staff member grooming and responsiveness
			4.&#9;Service – only for inquiries
			<p>The objective of the mystery audits was to discover service delivery gaps in order to facilitate continuous improvements to the customer experience, which SLT believes to be the key business differentiator in the competitive business environment of today.</p>
