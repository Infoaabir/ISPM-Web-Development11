		<h2>2.  Basis of preparation</h2>
		<h3>(a)  Statement of compliance</h3>
		<p>The Financial Statements of the Group and the Company which comprises the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Profit or Loss and other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS and LKAS) as laid down by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and the requirements of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.</p>
		<h3>(b)</h3>
		<p><span>The Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with the resolution of the Directors on 3&nbsp;June&nbsp;2020.</span></p>
		<h3>(c)  Basis of measurement</h3>
		<p>The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis applied consistently with no adjustments being made for inflationary factors affecting the financial statements except for the following item:</p>
		<p>The liability for defined benefit obligation recognised is actuarially valued and recognised at the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.</p>
		<h3>(d)  Functional and presentation currency</h3>
		<p>These Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lanka rupees, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency. All financial information presented in rupees has been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
		<h3>(e)  Use of estimates and judgements</h3>
		<p>The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards requires Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
		<p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.</p>
		<p>Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is included in the following Notes:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Note 14 – Property, plant and equipment</li>
			<li>Note 15 – Intangible assets</li>
			<li>Note 14 (a) – Lease assets and Liabilities</li>
			<li>Note 20 – Trade and other receivable</li>
			<li>Note 23 – Deferred tax</li>
			<li>Note 24 – Deferred income</li>
			<li>Note 26 – Employee benefits</li>
			<li>Note 24 (a) – Contracts assets</li>
			<li>Note 24 (b) – Contract liabilities</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>(f)  Current versus non-current classification</h3>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>The Group presents assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position based on current/non-current classification.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An asset is current when it is:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Expected to be released or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle</li>
			<li>Held primarily for the purpose of trading</li>
			<li>Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Or</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">

			<li>It is expected to be settled in the normal cycle</li>
			<li>It is held primarily for the purpose of trading</li>
			<li>It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period</li>
			<li>There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period</li>
			<li>The terms of the liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification</li>

		<h2>3.  Significant accounting policies</h2>
		<p>The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in financial statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group entities, except new accounting standards effective from 1 January 2019 as described in Note 3 (v).</p>
		<h3>(a)  Basis of consolidation</h3>
		<h4>(i)  Business combinations</h4>
		<p>The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.</p>
		<p>The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.</p>
		<p>Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.</p>
		<p>Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.</p>
		<p> 
    After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.</p>
		<p>
    Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Subsidiaries</h4>
		<p>Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control over the subsidiary.<br /></p>
		<h5>(ii-a)  Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies</h5>
		<p>The directors have concluded that the Group controls all subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-b).</p>
		<h5>(ii-b)  Interest in subsidiaries</h5>
		<p>Set out below are the Group’s principal subsidiaries as at 31 December 2019.</p>

		<h4>(iii)  Equity-accounted investees (Investment in associates and joint ventures)</h4>
		<p>An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.</p>
		<p>A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.</p>
		<p>The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control is similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its associates and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.</p>
		<p>Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.</p>
		<p>The Statement of Profit or Loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s Other Comprehensive Income. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.</p>
		<p>The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of the Statement of Profit or Loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.</p>
		<p>The Financial Statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.</p>
		<p>After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as “Share of profit or loss of equity accounted investees” in the Statement of Profit or Loss.</p>
		<p>Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.</p>
		<h4>(iv) Non-conrtolling interest (NCI)</h4>
		<p>NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</p>
		<h4>(v)  Loss of control</h4>
		<p>When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.</p>
		<h4>(vi)  Transactions eliminated on consolidation</h4>
		<p>Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.</p>
		<h3>(b)  Foreign currency</h3>
		<h4>(i)  Foreign currency transactions</h4>
		<p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.</p>
		<h3>(c)  Financial instruments</h3>
		<p>A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.</p>
		<h4>(i)  Financial assets</h4>
		<h5>(i-i)  Initial recognition and measurement</h5>
		<p>Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss.</p>
		<p>The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price as disclosed in Note 3 (k) – Revenue from contracts with customers. </p>
		<p>In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.</p>
		<p>The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.</p>
		<p>Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.</p>
		<h5>(i-ii)  Subsequent measurement</h5>
		<p>For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories;</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)</li>
			<li>Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)</li>
			<li>Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)</li>
			<li>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)</h6>
		<p>The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and</li>
			<li>The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified, or impaired.</p>
		<p>The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost include trade and other receivables, amounts due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents.</p>
		<h6>
	    Financial assets at fair value through OCI (debt instruments)</h6>
		<p>The Group measures debt instruments at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling, and</li>
			<li>The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value changes are recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI is recycled to profit or loss.</p>
		<h6>Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI (equity instruments)</h6>
		<p>Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under LKAS 32 – “Financial Instruments: Presentation” and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.</p>
		<p>Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.</p>
		<p>This category includes listed and non-listed equity instruments that the Group elected to classify irrevocably.</p>
		<h6>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss</h6>
		<p>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.</p>
		<p>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
		<p>This category includes derivative instruments and listed equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established.</p>
		<p>
    A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if: the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.</p>
		<h5>(i-iii)  Fair value measurement</h5>
		<p>SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactions between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
		<p>A fair value measurement requires an entity to determine all the following;</p>
		<ol class="list list-123">
		  <li>The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement.
		    </li>
		  <li>For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and best use).
		    </li>
		  <li>The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. </li>
		  <li>The valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorised.
		    </li>
		  <li>Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market.
		    </li>
		  </ol>
		<p>When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.</p>
		<h6>Determination of fair values</h6>
		<p>The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other risks affecting the specific instrument.</p>
		<ul class="list list-dash">
		  <li><strong>Level 1</strong> – Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
		    </li>
		  <li><strong>Level 2</strong> – Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
		    </li>
		  <li><strong>Level 3</strong> – Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
		    </li>
		  </ul>
		<h5>(i-iv)  Amortised cost</h5>
		<p>The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.</p>
		<h5>(i-v)  Impairment</h5>
		<h6>Non-derivative financial assets.</h6>
		<p>Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
		<p>Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes;</p>
		<ul class="list list-dash">
		  <li>	      default or delinquency by a debtor;
		    –&#9;restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
		    
		    </li>
		  <li>indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;</li>
		  <li>
		    adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;
		    </li>
		  <li>
		    the disappearance of an active market for a security; or
		    </li>
		  <li>
		    Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets.
		    </li>
		  </ul>

		<p>In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
		<p>For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECLs). Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.</p>
		<p>Investments in fixed deposits, Treasury Bills and Bonds are considered as low risk of default.</p>
		<h6>Non-financial assets</h6>
		<p>At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.</p>
		<p>For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.</p>
		<p>Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.</p>
		<p>The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.</p>
		<p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
		<p>Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.</p>
		<p>An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>
		<h5>(i-vi)  Hedge</h5>
		<p>For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognised directly in equity in the “cash flow hedge reserve”. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the hedge instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss.</p>
		<p>When the hedge cash flow affects the Income Statement, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line of the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/losses existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains 
	    in other comprehensive income and is recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains/loss was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Financial liabilities</h4>
		<h5>(ii-i)  Initial recognition and measurement</h5>
		<p>Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.</p>
		<p>The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, lease liabilities, contract liabilities and deferred income. </p>
		<h5>(ii-ii)  Subsequent measurement</h5>
		<h6>Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings)</h6>
		<p>This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, after considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised. EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss. </p>
		<h5>(ii-iii)  Derecognition</h5>
		<p>A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
		<h4>(iii) Offsetting of financial instruments</h4>
		<p>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.</p>
		
		<div id="note3_d">
		<h3>(d)  Property, plant and equipment</h3>
		<h4>(i)  Recognition and measurement</h4>
		<p>Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. </p>
		<p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that asset. </p>
		<p>When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Subsequent costs</h4>
		<p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
		<h4>(iii)  Depreciation</h4>
		<p>Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.</p>
		<p>Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.</p>
		<p>The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:</p>

		<h4>(iv)  Capital Work-in-Progress</h4>
		<p>Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.</p>
		<p>Major spare parts and project related inventory qualify as Property, plant and equipment when the entity expects to use them during more than one year period and are used in connection with specific items of Property, plant and equipment.</p>
		<h4>(v)  Derecognition</h4>
		<p>The carrying amount of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment is derecognised on disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within “other income” in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.</p>
		<p>When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, Plant and Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.</p>
		<h4>(vi)  Borrowing cost</h4>
		<p>Borrowing cost directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.</p>
		
			</div>
		
		
		<h3>(e)  Intangible assets</h3>
		<h4>(i)  Goodwill</h4>
		<p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see note 3 (a) (i).</p>
		<h5><strong>Subsequent measurement</strong></h5>
		<p>Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Other intangible assets</h4>
		<p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>
		<h4>(iii)  Licenses</h4>
		<p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as license fee and is being amortised over the License period on a straight line basis.</p>
		<h4>(iv)  Subsequent expenditure</h4>
		<p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>
		<h3>(f)  Leased assets</h3>
		<p>Prior to 1 January 2019, leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset was measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset was accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.</p>
		<p>Prior to 1 January 2019, for operating leases, the leased assets were not recognised on the Group’s statement of Financial Position.</p>
		<h3>(g)  Inventories</h3>
		<p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle. Value of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.</p>
		<h3>(h)  Share capital</h3>
		<h4>Ordinary Share Capital</h4>
		<p>Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.</p>
		<h3>(i)  Government grants</h3>
		<p>Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the of profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.</p>
		<h3>(j)  Employee benefits</h3>
		<h4>(i)  Defined contribution plans</h4>
		<p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. </p>
		<h5>Employees’ Provident Fund </h5>
		<p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
		<p>All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which the respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances. Employees of Sri lanka Telecom (Services) Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), where the company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
		<h5>Employees’ Trust Fund</h5>
		<p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Defined benefit plans</h4>
		<p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits” The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations.</p>
		<p>The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan in other comprehensive income. </p>
		<p>The present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the defined retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 26. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.</p>
		<p>Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the first year of service for all employees, in conformity with LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises only on completion of five years of continued service.</p>
		<h4>(iii)  Termination benefits</h4>
		<p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.</p>
		<h4>(iv)  Short-term benefits</h4>
		<p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.</p>
		<p>A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.</p>
		
		<div id="note3_k">
		<h3>(k)  Revenue from contracts with customers</h3>
		<p>The Group is primarily involved in providing a broad portfolio of telecommunication services across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of services provided by the Group include, <span>inter allia</span>, voice and broadband services, domestic and international leased circuits, broadband, satellite up-link, maritime transmission, IPTV service, directory publishing service and educational services.</p>
		<p>Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.</p>
		<h4>(i)  Performance obligations relevant to contracts</h4>
		<p>As a telecommunication service provider, the Group’s performance obligation related to service contracts include the installation services and maintenance services provided and the uninterrupted telecommunication service which will be provided throughout the connection period. </p>
		<p>The Group expects that above performance obligations would be satisfied throughout the connection period. </p>
		<h5>Domestic and international call revenue and rental income</h5>
		<h6>Fixed line</h6>
		<p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as and when services are performed. Fixed monthly rental is recognised as revenue on a monthly basis in relation to the period of services rendered.</p>
		<h6>Mobile revenue</h6>
		<p>Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the provision of other mobile telecommunications services. Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Airtime, either from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid customers through the sale of prepaid cards, is recorded in the period in which the customer uses the service.</p>
		<h5>Revenue from other network operators and international settlements</h5>
		<p>The revenue received from other network operators, local and international, for the use of the Group’s telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second at rates stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.</p>
		<p>Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic between other telecommunications operators is recognised at the time of transit across the Group’s network and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued is recognised under income in the Income Statement and interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs in profit or loss.</p>
		<h5>Revenue from broadband</h5>
		<p>Revenue from data services and IPTV services is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.</p>
		<h5>Revenue from other ICT services</h5>
		<p>The revenue from other telephone services are recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered between the Group and subscribers.</p>
		<h5>Recognition of deferred income</h5>
		<p>The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over the contractual period. Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.</p>
		<p>IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE cable capacity are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.</p>
		<p>Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE cable capacity is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue.</p>
		<p>Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.</p>
		<p>Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for prepaid subscribers are initially recognised as deferred revenue until such time as the subscribers use the services or credit period expires.</p>
		<h5>CDMA revenue</h5>
		<p>The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the point the connection is activated.</p>
		<h4>(ii) New connection fees</h4>
		<p>The Group provides installation services relevant to the new connections of fixed and mobile telecommunication services including both voice and non-voice categories. These installation services are bundled together with providing of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to customers in fixed line voice and some non-voice services. When the performance obligations relevant to such installation services are performed, CPEs provided to customers are considered as assets of the Group as long as the contracts with customers are valid. Accordingly, the Group allocates a bundled price for the equipment and installation services for such services.</p>
		<h4>(iii) Recognition of contract liability</h4>
		<p>The Group concluded that revenue from new connections in fixed and mobile telecommunication services is to be recognised over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. The fact that another entity would not need to re-perform the installation of the service that the Group has provided to date demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance as it performs.</p>
		<p>The Group identifies the revenue for installation services as a contract liability and recognises the revenue on a systematic basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related goods or services to the customer since satisfaction for the installation services will be consumed by the customer over the contract period.</p>
		<h4>(iv) Costs incurred in securing customer contracts </h4>
		<p>The Group identifies the sales commission paid to sales team for each new connection contract and other such related costs in contract acquisition as costs incurred in securing customer contracts.</p>
		<h4>(v) Recognition of contract asset</h4>
		<p>Contract acquisition costs are recognised as a contract asset and subsequently recognised as an expense over the life of a contract on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of services to which the asset relates, that is; as and when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for a given month.</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<h3>(l)  Expenditure</h3>
		<p>The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit for the year</p>
		<h3>(m)  Lease payments</h3>
		<p>Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.</p>
		<p>Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.</p>
		<p>At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.</p>
		<h3>(n)  Finance income and expenses</h3>
		<p>The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Interest income from repurchase agreements</li>
			<li>Interest income from fixed deposits</li>
			<li>Staff loan interest income</li>
			<li>Interest expense from borrowings</li>
			<li>Interest expense arising from Leases</li>
			<li>Foreign exchange gains or losses</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive payment is established.</p>
		<h3>(o) Income tax </h3>
		<p>Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at amounts to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.</p>
		<h4>(i) Current taxation</h4>
		<p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised or profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>
		<p>Provisions for taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and the amendments thereto.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Deferred Taxation</h4>
		<p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and taxable temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets liabilities will be realised simultaneously.</p>
		<p>A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries as the Parent Company has control over the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>
		<p>Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss, is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in Statement of Changes in Equity in line with the underlying transaction.</p>
		<p>No deferred taxation is provided for Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd. due to the fact that the income taxes are computed and paid at 2% on revenue.</p>
		<h4>(iii)  Economic Service Charge (ESC)</h4>
		<p>ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed payment can be carried forward and set off against the income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act. With effect from 1 January 2020 the Act mentioned above was abolished.</p>
		<h4>(iv) Sales tax</h4>
		<p>Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sale tax, except: where sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable.</p>
		<h3>(p)  Earnings per share </h3>
		<p>The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.</p>
		<p>Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</p>
		<h3>(q)  Insurance reserve </h3>
		<p>The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings an amount equal to 0.25% of additions to property, plant and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover any losses arising from damage to property, plant and equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured with a third party insurer.</p>
		<h3>(r)  Dividend distribution</h3>
		<p>Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.</p>
		<p>Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the dividend recommended and declared by the Board of Directors, is approved by the shareholders.</p>
		<h3>(s)  Comparatives</h3>
		<p>Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in respect of the previous period. Where the presentation or classification of items in the Financial Statements are amended, comparative amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.</p>
		<h3>(t) Cash flow statement</h3>
		<p>The Cash Flow Statement has been prepared using the “indirect method” of preparing cash flows in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – “Statement of Cash Flows”. Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. The cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, money at call and short notice.</p>
		<h3>(u)  Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements</h3>
		<p>In the preparation of these Financial Statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its financial performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.</p>
		<h4>(i)  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment</h4>
		<p>The Company assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.</p>
		<p>Where the Company determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any change in an asset’s life or residual value is reflected in the Company’s Financial Statements when the change in estimate is determined.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets</h4>
		<p>The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following;</p>
		<ol class="list list-abc">
		  <li>obsolescence or physical damage;
		    </li>
		  <li>significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;
		    </li>
		  <li>significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
		    </li>
		  <li>significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;
		    </li>
		  </ol>
		<p>The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units require significant judgement.</p>
		<h4>(iii)  Revenue recognition</h4>
		<p>Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.</p>
		<h4>(iv)  Valuation of receivables</h4>
		<p>The provision for impairment losses for trade and other receivables reflects the Company’s estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of customers to make required payments. The provision is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer credit-worthiness and the Company’s historical write-off experience etc. Changes to the provision may be required if the financial condition of its customers improves or deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs.</p>
		<h4>(v)  Inventories</h4>
		<p>The Company assesses the inventory provision whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following;</p>
		<p>a.&#9;obsolescence or physical damage;
		  </p>
		<p>b.&#9;significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;
		  </p>
		<p>c.&#9;significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;
		  </p>
		<h4>(vi)  Current Tax and Deferred tax</h4>
		<p>Judgement was required to determine the total provision for current, deferred and other taxes due to uncertainties that exist with respect to the interpretation of the applicability of tax law at the time of the preparation of these financial statements. </p>
		<p>Certain uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Where the final tax outcome of such matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income and deferred tax amounts in the period in which the determination is made.</p>
		<p>Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.</p>
		<h4>(vii)  Leases – Estimating the incremental borrowing rate</h4>
		<p>The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group “would have to pay”, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs such as market interest rates when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates as well.</p>
		<h4>(viii)  Revenue recognition from contracts with customers</h4>
		<p>Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. Certain contracts with customers are bundled packages that may include sale of products and telecommunications services that comprise voice, data, and other telecommunications services. The Group accounts for individual products and services separately as separate performance obligations if they are distinct promised goods and services. The Group exercises judgements in determining whether a product is distinct, that is, if such product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it separately. This determination will affect the allocation of consideration specified in the contract and the revenue recognised for each performance obligation.</p>
		<h3>(v) New accounting standards</h3>
		<p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has issued the following new Sri Lanka Accounting Standards which will become applicable for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.</p>
		<p><span>Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures</span></p>
		<h4>New and amended standards and interpretations</h4>
		<h4><span>(a) SLFRS 16 Leases</span></h4>
		<p>The Group applied SLFRS 16 for the first time. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of adoption of these new accounting standards are described below:</p>
		<p>Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.</p>
		<p>SLFRS 16 supersedes LKAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to recognise most leases on the balance sheet.</p>
		<p>Lessor accounting under SLFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from LKAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in LKAS 17. Therefore, SLFRS 16 does not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor.</p>
		<p>The Group adopted SLFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption, without restating comparative information. The impact on adoption of SLFRS 16 is reflected in Note 14. (a) to the Financial Statements. The Group also elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (short-term leases), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (low-value assets).</p>
		<h6>Leases</h6>
		<p>The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.</p>
		<h6>Group as a lessee</h6>
		<p>The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.</p>
		<h6>Right-of-use assets</h6>
		<p>The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:</p>
		
			<table class="gt">
				<colgroup>
					<col />
					<col />
					<col />
				</colgroup>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>
							Assets 
						</td>
						<td>
							Estimated useful lives
						</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>

							Land
						</td>
						<td>
							2-3 years
						</td>

						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							Towers
						</td>
						<td>
							2-3 years
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		
		<p>If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment as more fully described In Note (W) (ii) – Impairment of Assets.</p>
		<h6>Lease liabilities</h6>
		<p>At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. </p>
		<p>In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.</p>
		<p>The Group’s operating lease liabilities are included in Note 14. (a) to the Financial Statements.</p>
		<h6>Leases of low-value assets</h6>
		<p>The Group applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of some tower rentals that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p>
		<h6>Group as a lessor</h6>
		<p>Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.</p>
		<p>The lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows:</p>

		<h5>(b)  IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment</h5>
		<p>The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of LKAS 12 Income Taxes. It does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of LKAS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments. The Interpretation specifically addresses the following:</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately</li>
			<li>The assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities</li>
			<li>How an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates</li>
			<li>How an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances </li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments and uses the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. </p>
		<p>The Group applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments and it assessed whether the Interpretation had an impact on its consolidated financial statements.</p>
		<p>Upon adoption of the Interpretation, the Group considered whether it has any uncertain tax positions. The Group determined, based on its tax compliance and transfer pricing study that it is probable that its tax treatments (including those for the subsidiaries) will be accepted by the taxation authorities. The Interpretation did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.</p>
		<h5>(c)  Amendments to SLFRS 9:</h5>
		<p>Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation Under SLFRS 9, a debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, provided that the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’ (the SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held within the appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to SLFRS 9 clarify that a financial asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of an event or circumstance that causes the early termination of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.</p>
		<h5>(d)  Amendments to LKAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement</h5>
		<p>The amendments to LKAS 19 address the accounting when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during a reporting period. The amendments specify that when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during the annual reporting period, an entity is required to determine the current service cost for the remainder of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, using the actuarial assumptions used to remeasure the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that event. An entity is also required to determine the net interest for the remainder of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that event, and the discount rate used to remeasure that net defined benefit liability (asset).</p>
		<p>The amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it did not have any plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements during the period.</p>
		<h5>(e)  Amendments to LKAS 28: Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures</h5>
		<p>The amendments clarify that an entity applies SLFRS 9 to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is not applied but that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture (long-term interests). This clarification is relevant because it implies that the expected credit loss model in SLFRS 9 applies to such long-term interests.</p>
		<p>The amendments also clarified that, in applying SLFRS 9, an entity does not take account of any losses of the associate or joint venture, or any impairment losses on the net investment, recognised as adjustments to the net investment in the associate or joint venture that arise from applying LKAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. </p>
		<p>These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Group does not have long term interests in its associate and joint venture.</p>
		<h5>(f)  Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle</h5>
		<h6>SLFRS 3 Business Combinations</h6>
		<p>The amendments clarify that, when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including remeasuring previously held interests in the assets and liabilities of the joint operation at fair value. In doing so, the acquirer remeasures its entire previously held interest in the joint operation.</p>
		<p>An entity applies those amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application permitted.</p>
		<p>These amendments had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as there is no transaction where joint control is obtained.</p>
		<h6>SLFRS 11 Joint Arrangements</h6>
		<p>An entity that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain joint control of the joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business as defined in SLFRS 3. The amendments clarify that the previously held interests in that joint operation are not remeasured.</p>
		<p>An entity applies those amendments to transactions in which it obtains joint control on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application permitted.</p>
		<p>These amendments had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as there is no transaction where a joint control is obtained.</p>
		<h6>LKAS 12 Income Taxes</h6>
		<p>The amendments clarify that the income tax consequences of dividends are linked more directly to past transactions or events that generated distributable profits than to distributions to owners. Therefore, an entity recognises the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where it originally recognised those past transactions or events.</p>
		<p>An entity applies the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application permitted. When the entity first applies those amendments, it applies them to the income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period.</p>
		<p>Since the Group’s current practice is in line with these amendments, they had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.</p>
		<h6>LKAS 23 Borrowing Costs</h6>
		<p>The amendments clarify that an entity treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing originally made to develop a qualifying asset when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.</p>
		<p>The entity applies the amendments to borrowing costs incurred on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies those amendments. An entity applies those amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application permitted.</p>
		<p>Since the Group’s current practice is in line with these amendments, they had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.</p>
		<h3>(w)  Standards Issued but not yet Effective</h3>
		<p>The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.</p>
		<h4>(i)  Amendments to SLFRS 3: Definition of a Business</h4>
		<p>Amendments to the definition of a business in SLFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.</p>
		<p>Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after the date of first application, the Group will not be affected by these amendments on the date of transition.</p>
		<h4>(ii)  Amendments to LKAS 1 and LKAS 8: Definition of Material</h4>
		<p>In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to LKAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and LKAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to align the definition of “material” across the standards and to clarify certain aspects of the definition. The new definition states that, ’Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.</p>
		<p>The amendments to the definition of material are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.</p>

		<h2>4.  Financial risk management</h2>
		<p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.</p>
		<p>The Group’s risk management processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the group activities.</p>
		<p>The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management processes/guidelines and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal reviews of risk management controls and procedures. The results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.</p>
		<p>The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:</p>
		–&#9;Credit risk, Liquidity risk and market risk
		<p>This Note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. Further, quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</p>
		<h3>4.1  Credit risk</h3>
		<p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation, and arise principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.</p>
		<p>Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.</p>
		<h4>4.1.1  Trade receivables</h4>
		<p>The Group having a very well established credit policy for both International Interconnect customers and Domestic customers to minimise the credit risk. A separate committee has been established to evaluate the credit worthiness of the International Interconnect customer. Further, prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating credit risk.</p>
		<p>Domestic service is offered to a new customer only after scrutinising through an internal blacklisted data base. The Group has a well-established credit control policy and process to minimise the credit risk. Customers are categorised according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit limit is periodically revised as per the past monthly bill value. High risk voice customers are subjected to auto disconnection when they reach the threshold limit. Credit control and recovery actions are taken in respect of customers with overdue accounts to minimise the credit risk. High revenue generating customers including corporate customers are monitored individually.</p>
		<p>As at 31 December 2019, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade by geographic region was as follows:</p>

		<h4>4.1.2  Other investments</h4>
		<p>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in Government Debt Securities, Repos and in short-term deposits with selected banks with Board approval.</p>
		<h4>4.1.3  Cash and cash equivalents</h4>
		<p>The Group held cash and cash equivalents of LKR 5,457 Mn. as at 31 December 2019 (2018 LKR 11,089 Mn.)</p>
		<h4>4.1.4  Employee loans</h4>
		<p>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by ensuring the loan balance are recovered from the employees monthly salary, or if the employee leaves such amounts are recovered from the employees EPF balance.</p>
		<h3>4.2  Liquidity risk</h3>
		<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.</p>
		<p>The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
		<p>Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the Treasury Division.</p>
		<p>Contractual undiscounted payments the Sri Lanka Telecom PLC would be called upon to make under the issued Corporate Guarantee Contracts on behalf of its subsidiaries are as follows, </p>

		<h3>4.3  Market risk</h3>
		<p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. </p>
		<h4>4.3.1  Currency risk</h4>
		<p>The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the Sri Lankan rupees (LKR).</p>
		<p>The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.</p>

		<h4>4.3.2  Interest rate risk</h4>
		<p>Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of the Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>
		<p>Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.&#9;</p>
		<p>Interest rate sensitivity of the Company was computed within the floor interest rate (minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below;</p>

		<h2>5.  Operating segments</h2>
		<p>The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic divisions, the board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker-CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.</p>
		<ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.</li>
			<li>Mobile ICT operations includes supply of Mobile telecommunication services.</li>
			<li>Other segment operations includes Directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2019 or 2018.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax. As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is used to measure performance as Management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</p>

			<h2>8.  Refunds on Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC)</h2>
			<p>In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri Lanka, based on international call minutes terminated in the country. This levy was made effective from 3 March, 2003 where initially the levy was defined in such a way that Operators were allowed to claim 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges.</p>
			<p>The TDC Refund received in 2014 corresponds to the period from April 2009 to July 2010 which was the last claim obtained under the respective regulation. As the said regulation was received with effect from July 2010 while eliminating the reimbursement process, the final claim requested from TRC applicable for the above period was received in year 2014.</p>
			<p>First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July 2010 with an International Telecommunication Operators Levy (ITOL) TDC rate change from USD cents 3.80 to USD cents 1.50. Through the same revision, the disbursement process of TDC was removed from the regulation. As stated above the revised ITOL rate prevailed until such time the rate was revised to USD cents 3.00 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012 and ITOL rate was further revised again to USD cents 6.00 per minute with effect from January 2016 in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2016.</p>
			<p>Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd. recognises Telecommunications Development Charge (TDC) in Statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 10 years, as disclosed in Note 33.</p>

			<h3>Hedging activities</h3>
			<p>The Group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Group uses foreign currency-denominated borrowings to manage some of its transaction exposures. The primary risks managed using hedging activities is the foreign currency risk.</p>
			<p>The Group’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage foreign currency risk are explained in Note 4.3.1.</p>
			<p>There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as there is an opposite relationship between currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies which are generated from day-to-day business operations and currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans which are on fixed terms.</p>
			<p>The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange are identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks.</p>
			<p>The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments</li>
				<li>Changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments</li>

			<h3>Tax credits</h3>
			<p>The Company has tax credits of LKR 1,289 Mn. (2018 – LKR 1,289 Mn.) that are available indefinitely for offsetting against future taxable profits of the company. The Company will be able to recover this amount and recognise a deferred tax asset as and when the current unused tax losses are fully utilised and sufficient taxable profits are available to claim against this unused tax credit. </p>
			<p>At the end of each reporting year, the Company reassesses its unrecognised deferred tax assets and recognises them only to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.</p>

			<h2>24.  Deferred income</h2>
			–&#9;The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.
			–&#9;Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit and Internet is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.
			–&#9;Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue.
			–&#9;IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 cable capacity is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.

			<p>In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial valuation. In 2019,1967/70 Mortality Table issued by the Institute of Actuaries London (2018 – 1967/70 Mortality Table) was taken as the base for the valuation.</p>
			<p>The provisions for defined obligations of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, SLT Human Capital Solutions (Private) Limited, SLT Publications (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) Limited, SLT Campus (Private) Limited, SLT Visioncom (Private) Limited and Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd. are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S Goonetilleke and Associates respectively.</p>
			<p>The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded. </p>
			<h3>Sensitivity analysis</h3>
			<p>Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amount shown below.</p>
			<p>The sensitivity of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position is the effect of the assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted in the following table.</p>

			<h2>35.  Events after the reporting date</h2>
			<p>The Board of Directors of the Company has recommended a first and final dividend of LKR 1.06 per share (2018 – LKR 1.06 per share) on voting shares of the Company to be paid by way of cash dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2019.</p>
			<p>Further, this dividend is to be approved at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 July 2020. This proposed final dividend has not been recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2019. Final dividend proposed for the year amounts to LKR 1,913,151,600, in  Compliance with Section 56 and 57 of Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. As required by Section 56 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company satisfied the solvency test in accordance with the Section 57, prior to recommending the final dividend. A statement of solvency completed and duly signed by the Directors on 18 June 2020 has been audited by Messrs Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
			<h3>COVID-19 – Pandemic</h3>
			<p>Since 31 December 2019, the spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many local economies around the globe. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to curtail the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced great volatility and a significant weakening. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilise economic conditions.</p>
			<p>The below summarises the financial impact to the Group,</p>
			<h3>Impact to earnings</h3>
			<p>In the short run, the Company has experienced immediate increase in usage of Broadband and IPTV services by the residential sector and data products by the business sector in shifting towards work from home arrangements in continuing the businesses. At the same time, we foresee opportunities in the future with increasing online activity and demand for distance services. However, overall in the short and medium terms the Company expects pressure on earnings from negatively affected industries such as tourism, travel, and apparel industries.</p>
			<h3>Impact to cash flows</h3>
			<p>Low disposable income levels of the customers coupled with regulatory instructions to refrain from disconnecting the unpaid subscribers, the collection of billed revenue is a challenge which may be mitigated in the short term by the Government’s decision on extending the due dates for the payment of some taxes and levies, easing pressure on cash flows of customers. In order to mitigate the cash-flow related challenges, the Board of Directors have decided to limit capital nature expenditure only for the vital areas and to utilise the procurement models with deferred payment plans. </p>
			<h3>Impact from exchange rate variation</h3>
			<p>Some of the expenses of the Company are in the form of foreign currencies. Prevailing depreciation of the Rupee is affecting to escalate the expenses in terms of local currency. Actions are being taken to minimise such expenses or to renegotiate with suppliers on prices. Since the foreign currency denominated loan balances are at a low level, the associated risk is minimum.</p>
			<p>The Company has determined that these events are non-adjusting subsequent events. Accordingly, the financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 have not been adjusted to reflect their impact. The duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of Government and Central Bank responses, remains unclear at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences, as well as their impact on the financial position and results of the Company for future periods.</p>
			<p>Except as disclosed above, no other events have arisen since the Statement of Financial Position date which require changes to, or disclosure in the Financial Statements.</p>
