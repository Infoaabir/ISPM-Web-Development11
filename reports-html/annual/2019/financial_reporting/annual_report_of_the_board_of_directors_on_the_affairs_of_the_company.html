		<p>Given that the two controlling shareholders are considered “non-public”, the public free float has reduced to 5.52% of the shareholding. In view of the current situation, SLT is proposing the issue of a maximum of 89,766,198 new ordinary voting shares representing 4.74% of the issued share capital post Private Placement in order to comply with the rules on minimum public float issued by the Colombo Stock Exchange. The funds expected to be raised through the Private Placement will be utilised to restructure the debt portfolio of SLT.</p>
		<h3>Voting rights</h3>
		<p>Ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any General Meeting of the Company. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a General Meeting may appoint a proxy to attend and vote instead of him. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.</p>
		<p>Every shareholder present in person or by proxy (or being a corporation present by a duly authorised representative) shall have one vote on a show of hands and one vote for every share held by him on a poll.</p>
		<h2>Financial Statements</h2>
		<p>The Financial Statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS/LKASs), laid down by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and comply with the requirements of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. </p>
