<p align="justify" class="text">SLT&rsquo;s constantly growing network capacities, its state-of-the-art
  access technologies and its corporate vision present unlimited
  opportunities for entrepreneur, professional, farmer and other.
  <br>
  <br>
  In these 10 years since privatisation, SLT has focussed on
  strengthening its internal processes, systems and human resource
  culture. While not ignoring the &lsquo;external&rsquo; we have given priority to
  getting the &lsquo;internal&rsquo; dimensions in place in order to lay the foundation
  for our next phase of growth. In these 10 years we have faced many
  challenges. At the same time, it has been a huge learning experience
  for us. The time is now ripe to build on this learning.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exponential growth in new communications technologies
  SLT&rsquo;s focus over the next ten years will be on making optimum use
  of these technologies, opening a new world of opportunities for our
  broad range of customers and adding value to the country as a
  whole.<br>
  <br>
  Our current microwave and fibre optic network provides the right
  ambience for the migration into a Next Generation Network (NGN).
  Tomorrow&rsquo;s world will be one in which a single intelligent IP
  based network will provide a rainbow of converged services
  through this single platform. This platform will be complemented
  by island wide access technologies on copper and wireless network
  providing new and infinite possibilities. SLT is poised to usher in this
  technology rich and user friendly new world not just in Sri Lanka but
  in the entire South Asian region.<br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka&rsquo;s strategic location will ensure that the country plays a
  crucial role in the unfolding of new technologies across the different
  regions. Already SLT&rsquo;s investments in the SEA-ME-WE submarine
  cables and the Bharat-Lanka submarine cable, supported by satellite
  connectivity, have provided an unparalleled global connectivity and
  enhanced Sri Lanka&rsquo;s competitiveness in the global market.<br>
  <br>
  The challenge for the future will be a challenge of innovation: to
  present to the customer the unlimited opportunities that the new
  communications technology offers. The challenge will be to build a
  single platform to provide this broad spectrum of services with
  optimum clarity, efficiency and cost. Above all such networks should
  be simple and easily accessible to a wide range of consumers. SLT
  will leverage its investments in its existing network, its investments in
  NGN and its leadership role in the region to ensure that it becomes
  the powerhouse of communications and opens up unlimited
  opportunities for Sri Lanka. Its investments in its human resource
  capabilities will ensure the Company is geared with the marketing
  and customer skills to capitalise on its product and technology
assets.</p>
