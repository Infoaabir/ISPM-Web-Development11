</ul>

</div>
<div class="inner_cntn">
<h4>Strategic Governance Board (SGB)</h4>
<p>Strategic Governance Board comprising the CEO and the Chief Officers of each functional area was created to study the requirements of the cross functional areas and introduce solutions in a more transparent manner whilst bringing efficiencies to each of the new processes, projects or investments through structured planning, governance and controlled project delivery. The introduction of governance boards consisting of cross functional decision making teams have eliminated the common bottlenecks associated with introducing and implementing new programmes and reducing the investment risk. More importantly these governance boards have introduced methodical evaluation of new projects/ programmes and post evaluations of the projects in order to allocate resources only to those projects that meet the strategic objectives of the Company. There are six cross functional governance boards - Transformation and Change Governance Board, Product Governance Board, IT Governance Board, Network Governance Board, Facilities and Services Governance Board, and Enterprise Solutions Governance Board-that operate under the CEO headed by each of the relevant Chief Officers.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Six stages during which a project is progressively taken from conception through to review and closed</li>
    <li>Eight gates of review where the first seven present an opportunity for the Governance Board to assess whether or not to allocate further resources to the project and the last gate to allow review of the success of the project</li>
    </ul>

The Company Secretary also liaises with the CSE on all of the Company's communications. The Company Secretary also is responsible for announcing the AGM and any EGMs to the Shareholders and for accurate recording of proxy voting. Any decisions on the removal of the Company Secretary lie within the Board as a whole.</p>

<h4>Major Transactions</h4>
<p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Company's Act, has been disclosing to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to the SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2012.</p>

<h4>Whistleblowing Policy</h4>
<p>This policy introduced in 2012, addresses the commitment of SLT to uphold the integrity and ethical behaviour by helping to foster and maintain an environment where an employee can act appropriately without fear of retaliation. To maintain the standards of business conduct and ethics, the Company encourages its employees who have concerns about
suspected serious misconduct or any breach or suspected breach of law or regulation that may adversely affect the Company, to come forward and express these concerns without fear of punishment or unfair treatment.</p>

<span class="th4">Objectives of the policy</span>
<ol type="a">
	<li>To provide avenues for employees to raise concerns and define ways to handle these concerns.</li>
    <li>To enable the management to be informed at an early stage about acts of misconduct.</li>
    <li>To reassure employees that they will be protected from punishment or unfair treatment for disclosing concerns in good faith in accordance with this procedure.</li>
    <li>To help develop a culture of openness, accountability and integrity.</li>
  
</ol>

<span class="th4">Whistleblowing Committee</span>

<p>A committee consisting of seven members was formed to handle any cases referred. The quorum for the meeting is four members including Chairman, CEO, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Chief Officer who represents the subject has no voting power if he is represented in the Committee. The Secretary of the Whistleblowing Committee is to submit reports endorsed by its Chairman at every Audit Committee meeting.</p>

<h4>Outlook</h4>
<p>As a giant ICT provider in the country, SLT and its Board are constantly exploring ways to enhance its transparency in all decisions made. Thus, the staff, customers and all other stakeholders are encouraged to provide feedback in order for the management to have an understanding of the areas that need to be strengthened. The processes already in place captures the majority of concerns and complaints made by stakeholders and the Company is constantly evaluating these comments to enhance the governance process at SLT.</p><br /><br />

<span class="th3"><strong>Risk Management</strong></span>

<h4>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</h4>

<p>In the present context of a dynamic and volatile business environment, it is vital for an organisation to be adequately prepared to face the seen and the unforeseen challenges. SLT, like many other business enterprises have understood the importance of being prepared to capitalise on the opportunities in order to create value for the organisation and its customers, while accepting or mitigating the threats to minimise losses. In recent years, SLT has experienced challenges posed by the booming telecom industry with heightened competition and the resultant demands of customers. Therefore, under the direction of SLT's Board of Directors, a formal risk management process was introduced towards the latter part of 2010 and established the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework in 2011.</p>

<p>The ERM process introduced the development of a company- wide risk register and a risk escalation arrangement via various risk forums held throughout the organisation. The ERM process which is aligned to meet the ISO 31000 standards and also include components of COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission) recommendations will help develop a risk intelligent culture within the organisation bringing value to SLT, our customers and other stakeholders.</p>

<img src="images/erm_gov.png" width="681" />
</div>
<div class="inner_cntn">
<h4>Risk Management Process</h4>
<p>The Risk Management Process at SLT encourages a bottom-up approach whereby all staff are expected to participate in the risk identification process. The identified risks are then recorded in the risk registers which are maintained at Group level. The identified risks are then formally assessed with an assigned magnitude and escalated to the higher authorities of the Company for treatment.</p>

<p>The escalation process based on the magnitude of the risk can be elevated up to the level of the Board of Directors who is the ultimate governing body of ERM. The Board of Directors have recognised risk as a priority in the organisation, and assists with the efforts of the senior management team and the respective staff in enabling and creating a risk intelligent culture within the organisation. The Board of Directors has also delegated authority to the Audit Committee to ensure the level of effectiveness of the ERM process during respective implementation phases of the ERM programme.</p>

<h4>Implementation of ERM</h4>
<p>During the financial year under review, the Company carried out comprehensive programmes to create awareness on risk management throughout the organisation, covering the senior management team and key staff members.</p>

<p>These awareness programmes mainly focused on;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Visualising business critical risks and uncertainties Handling of such identified risks and uncertainties at the appropriate time</li>
    <li>Becoming a risk intelligent organisation where the ERM process is to reach its full maturity within a period of approximately five years, commencing 2012.</li>
    <li>Creating ERM ownership among top management (CEO and other Chief Officers) and the implementation of risk management processes at functional and project levels in several phases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful completion of training of all senior executives and the feedback received has enabled SLT to incorporate new project concepts into its 2013 annual business plan. These new project concepts are to enable SLT to become a SMART (Service, Management, Application, Relationship and Technology) player in the industry.</p>

<p>The financial year also saw the successful creation of functional teams under each operational group of the Company that will assist in implementing the risk management process. These teams have commenced their work and will progressively identify, analyse, evaluate, treat and monitor risks of the company.</p>

<p>Development of components of the ERM process such as creation of risk registers, designing of the risk assessment process, defining of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), identification of risk appetite levels etc. are in progress. Risk appetite - the amount of risk exposure or potential adverse impact from an event that the entity's Board and senior management are willing to accept are defined by the Board of Directors after careful analysis and deliberations with the Risk Management committees.</p>

<h4>Regulatory Risks</h4>
<span class="th4">National Backbone Network (NBN)</span>
<p>License granted to Sri Lanka Telecom in 1991 was renewed during the financial year with new conditions of converting the existing network to a National Backbone Network (NBN). As per the license, NBN operations have to commence after three (03) months from the date of issuance of the license and the network is to be developed with a roll out target to be achieved in five years. The target is such that in five years, NBN should be capable of providing services from 329 access points covering all Divisional Secretariats in the country.</p>

<p>Noncompliance of aforesaid target will be subject to a penalty charge of Rs.500,000 * (X-Y) where X is number of electorates to be covered and Y is actual number of electorates covered in each year. A performance bond worth of US$ 2,000,000 has also been imposed as a performance security of NBN. With the
implementation of NBN, the SLT backbone services presently being provided under the business of SLT's wholesale division will have to be operated on regulated terms governed by the SLT license conditions.
</p>

<p>Mitigating factor: SLT 's preparedness to meet these conditions of NBN license so as to not have a penalty imposed in the future.</p>

<span class="th4">Regulation of Tariffs</span>
<p>With the introduction of NBN, the prices of wholesale products provided may need to be revised as NBN services are regulated on the basis of cost of the service. In this context, the existing backbone charges will need to be revised to reduce the existing rates and approval for the revised charges will be obtained from TRCSL. Since the demand for the NBN is not yet foreseen and non-committed, the price revision of existing wholesale products might have a negative impact on the revenues of the wholesale products.</p>

<p>In the retail market, heavy competition especially in the international voice and broadband market is very challenging to SLT. The implications are such that sustainability of the revenues has become an issue which has ultimately resulted in eroding of margins of the same services.</p>

<p>Mitigating factor: SLT is in regular dialogue with the TRCSL to have pricing policies implemented in such areas.</p>

<span class="th4">Other policies of TRC</span>
<p>The Government has notified that new policies are yet to be introduced to the telecom sector. Though guidelines for broadband operations have already been issued to all operators for immediate implementation, a new Broadband Policy is to be issued in the near future. Furthermore, the Next Generation Network (NGN) Framework and review of the Telecommunication Act 25 of 1991 with new amendments are also to be issued by TRC.</p>

<h4>Legal Risks</h4>
<span class="th4">Litigation</span>
<p>It must be noted that it is impractical to forecast the outcome of any particular case or the amount of any possible verdict in respect of ongoing litigation. Nevertheless, the defences taken in those cases have the judicious features of both the law and the facts. SLT was a party to several court and out-of-court proceedings with other parties and detailed below is the summary of the material litigation during 2012.</p>

<p>Global Electroteks Limited has initiated legal action under High Court Case No. 20/2006 claiming damages of USD 12 million from SLT PLC for alleged unlawful disconnection of interconnection services.</p>

<p>Just In Time Holding (Pvt) Ltd (JIT) filed a case against SLT in ICLP Arbitration Centre. JIT is claiming USD 4,738,846.57, as payments due to them from SLT under the contract. The award was delivered on 30.03.2013 in favour of JIT, with damages, costs and legal interests. SLT has already filed an appeal against the Arbitral Award which is presently proceeding and SLT has received legal advise that it has sufficient legal grounds to challenge the arbitral award including damages, costs and legal interest under the award.</p>

<p>Legal action filed by SLT against Colombo Municipal Council, against the arbitrary increase of assessment value for Headquarters premises from Rs.84 million to Rs.96 million. The quarterly assessment tax in 2006 was increased from Rs.7,350,000/- to Rs.8,452,5000/-.</p>

<p>Legal action was initiated by H/S Communication Ltd., against SLT & SLT Visioncom (Pvt) Ltd., seeking a stay order against airing of certain channels by SLT Visioncom (Pvt) Ltd., and to recover arrears of US $ 486,000/-. SLT made representations and no stay order was granted, and HS Communication Ltd withdrew their application for the stay order. The main claim against SLT and SLT Visioncom (Pvt) Ltd. is proceeding.</p>

<p>Directories Lanka (Pvt) Limited claimed damages of Rs.250 million for alleged unfair competition with regard to artwork on the cover page of Directory of SLT. The order was delivered in favour of SLT and Directories Lanka has appealed against this order.</p>

<p>An inquiry was initiated by the Customs Department regarding the importation of CDMA equipment which was detained and subsequently released on a bank guarantee of Rs.122 million and presently this matter is being negotiated for a settlement.</p>


<h4>Financial Risks</h4>

<span class="th4">Liquidity Risk</span>
<p>Liquidity Risk is defined as a situation where the company finds it is unable to fulfill due payment obligations in a timely manner. This is a result of the company not having sufficient financial resources to meet the obligations thus requiring financing on unfavourable terms. This risk mainly arises from mismatches in the timing or maturity of cash flows.</p>
<p>A Company is vulnerable to Liquidity Risk if its credit rating falls. It experiences sudden unexpected cash outflows or some other event that causes counterparties to avoid trading with or lending to the company.</p>

<p>The liquidity of a company will depend on several factors such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Company's short-term need for cash</li>
    <li>Cash on hand</li>
    <li>Available lines of credit</li>
    <li>The liquidity of the company's financial assets</li>
    <li>The Company's reputation in the market place (i.e. how willing will counterparties be to transact trades with or lend to the company)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to manage this risk, SLT employs regular financial planning and monitoring systems to ensure that sufficient cash flows are available to meet all financial commitments as they fall due and ensure adequate credit lines are in place with Banks for emergency financing. Further, the investment of any excess funds is made in highly liquid instruments such as Government Securities, Repos and short term Fixed Deposits.</p>

<span class="th4">Credit Risk</span>
<p>The risk of the possibility of a loss being incurred as a result of inability of a debtor or a counterparty honouring its contractual obligations is known as Credit Risk. This can arise as a result of diminution of credit quality of debtors and other counterparties. This risk may not be limited to Statement of financial position items, but can also arise as a result of Off-Statement of financial position items such as Financial Guarantees.</p>

<p>In assessing Credit Risk from a single customer/counterparty, a company has to consider three main issues.</p>
<ul><li>Default probability â€“ the likelihood of the customer/ counterparty defaulting on its obligations.</li>
<li>Credit exposure â€“ In the event of a default, how large will the outstanding obligation be.</li>
<li>Recovery rate â€“ In the event of a default, what fraction of the exposure may be recovered.</li>

</ul>
<p>In order to manage this risk, SLT ensures that comprehensive systems and procedures are in place to monitor and evaluate debtors/counterparties and recoveries. Further, pre-paid sales are used as a means of mitigating Credit Risk.</p>

<p>In relation to investments, proper screening is done considering the Credit Ratings of such investing institutions/ Banks.</p>

<span class="th4">Interest Rate Risk</span>
<p>The impact on the Company as a result of changes in the market interest rate is known as Interest Rate Risk. This would be inevitable for a company having interest sensitive assets and liabilities and would arise mainly due to the following.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maturities of all interest sensitive assets cannot be identically matched with liabilities.</li>
    <li>Changes in market interest rates in response to market forces.</li>   
</ul>
<p>SLT's debt and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments with caps and floors where possible and periodic maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>
<span class="th4">Exchange Rate Risk</span>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk, which is also known as Currency Risk is a major source of market risk and is unavoidable in any entity where re-pricing of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities are not identically matched. This risk represents the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The company is exposed to Foreign Exchange Risk whenever it transacts
in any other currency other than SLT's base currency, Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR). This can be due to both transaction and translation risks.</p>

<p>The fluctuations of the Foreign Currency Rates in the global market can have adverse impacts on the company's foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The company manages its foreign exchange exposure by maintaining foreign currency accounts for related inflows and using same for paying off some of its liabilities in foreign currency. This serves as an effective hedging mechanism against foreign currency exposure. As a further measure, only optimum amounts are maintained in these foreign currency accounts and any excesses are converted to SLT's base currency (LKR) after carefully studying the future forecasts of the currency movements.</p>


<h4>HR Related Risks</h4>
<p>In the context of changing telecom business models, human capital is exceedingly important. Employee skill development, employee retention, aging workforce and escalation of employee cost are the most challenging areas in the present industry scenario. SLT has been successful in moulding existing employees according to future requirements, while maintaining one of the lowest employee turnover ratios
in the industry. SLT faces the challenge of managing more than 6,000 permanent employees. Hence, maintaining healthy relations among unions and the management and maintaining industrial harmony is imperative for the well being of the Company. SLT was able to resolve industrial conflicts during the year 2012, providing long term solutions through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the employee unions, management and shareholders and also through series of awareness sessions.</p>
