<br>

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The Audit Committee (the "Committee") is established as a committee of the Board. The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board of Directors of the Company in fulfilling its responsibilities in respect of:</p>

<h4>Independence of External Auditor</h4>
<p>Both the Board and the external auditor have for many years had safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor's objectivity and independence could be compromised. The issue of auditor independence is taken as an important governance requirement and is reviewed annually. A senior partner has been involved in providing greater senior level coverage. The fees for the services provided by them must be approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year ended 31 December 2012 and information on the nature of non-audit fees appear Note 6 on page 140 of the accounts.</p>

<h4>Internal Audit</h4>
<p>Internal audit independently reviews the risks and control processes operated by management.

As part of this process the Committee looks at the resources devoted to the function to ensure they are adequate to deliver the plan.</p>

<p>Internal audit reports include recommendations to improve internal controls together with agreed Management action plans to resolve the issues raised. Internal audit follows up the implementation of recommendations and reports progress to senior management and the Audit Committee.</p>

<p>Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2011 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2011 , the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.</p>

<p>The Group elects on a transaction by transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interest at its fair value, or its proportionate share of the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets , at the acquisition date. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.</p>

<span class="th4">Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2011</span>
<p>As part of its transition to SLFRSs the Group elected not to restate business combinations that occurred on or before 31 December 2010. In respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 2010, goodwill represents
the amount recognised under the Group's previous accounting framework. ["SLAS"]</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Acquisitions of non-controlling interests</span>
<p>Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.</p>

<p>Therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iii)	Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.</span>
<p>The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.</p>

<p>The financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared to common financial year end of 31st December.</p>
<p>There are no significant restrictions on the ability of Subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iv)	Loss of control</span>
<p>Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non- controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for financial instruments depending on the level of influence retained.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(v)	Transactions eliminated on consolidation</span>
<p>Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra- group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.</p>

<span class="th4">(b)	Foreign currency</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Foreign currency transactions</span>
<p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the period.</p>

<p>Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available-for- sale equity instruments which is recognised directly in equity.</p>

<p>Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Foreign Operations</span>
<p>The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Rupees at spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Rupees at spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.</p>

<p>Foreign currency differences on the translation of foreign operations are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2011, the Group's date of transition to SLFRSs, such differences have been recognised in the translation reserve.. When a foreign operation is disposed off, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes
a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation, are recognised in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve.</p>


<span class="th4">(c)	Financial assets and financial liabilities</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Non-derivative financial assets</span>
<p>The Group initialy recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets (including assets designated at the fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantialy all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts intends either to settle on a net basis or realise the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following non-derivative financial assets: loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.</p>

<span class="th4">Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.</span>
<p>A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sales decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group's documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss.</p>

<span class="th4">Held to-maturity financial assets.</span>
<p>If the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity, then such financial assets are classified as held -to -maturity. Held-to-maturity financial assets are recognised initialy at fair value plus any directly attributable transactions costs. Subsequent to inital recognition held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Any sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of held-to-maturity investments not close to their maturity would result in the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments as available-for-sale, and prevent the Group from classifying investment securities as held-to-maturity for the current and the following two financial years.</p>


<span class="th4">Loans and receivables</span>
<p>Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in and active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initaly recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.</p>

<p>Loans and receivable comprise cash and cash equivalents,staff loans and trade and other receivables, including related party receivables.</p>

<span class="th4">Cash and cash equivalents</span>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form
an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.</p>

<span class="th4">Available-for-sale financial assets</span>
<p>Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for- sale and that are not classified in any of the previous categories. The Group's investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available-for- sale financial assets. Subsequent to intial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale equity instruments (see note 3(b)(i)), are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the fair value reserve. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss.
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise debt instruments including government securities.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Non-derivative financial liabilities</span>
<p>
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other financial liabilities are recognised initialy on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial liability discharged or cancelled or expire.
</p>

<p>The Group has the following non-derivative financial liabilities :loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iii)	Share capital</span>
<span class="th4">Ordinary Share Capital</span>
<p>Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.</p>

<span class="th4">(d)	Property, plant and equipment</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Recognition and measurement</span>
<p>Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. As disclosed in Note 14, property, plant and equipment of the Department of Telecommunications were transferred to Sri Lanka Telecom at a valuation performed by the Government of Sri Lanka and was used as the opening cost of fixed assets. (The cost of certain items of property, plant
and equipment was determined by reference to a previous GAAP. The Group elected to apply the optional exemption to use this previous valuation as deemed cost at 1 January 2011, the date of transition.)</p>

<p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that asset.</p>

<p>When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Subsequent costs</span>
<p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the repleaced part is derecognised. The
costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iii)	Depreciation</span>
<p>Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put in to use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.</p>

<p>Depreciation method,useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. Estimates in respect of certain item of property,plant and equipment were revised with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p>The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:</p>
<div class="inner_figu">
	<ul>
    	<li>Freehold Buildings</li><li>5 – 40 years</li>
        <li>Ducts ,cables and other</li><li>&nbsp;</li>

        <li>Other Fixed Assets</li><li>4- 10 years</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iv)	Capital Work-in-Progress</span>
<p>Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.</p>  

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(v)	Derecognition</span>
<p>The carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment is derecognised on disposal.Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within "other income" in profit or loss.</p>

<p>When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.</p>
 
<span class="th4">(e)	Intangible assets</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Goodwill</span>
<p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition,see note 3(a)(i). The Group has elected to not apply SLFRS 3 retrospectively to
past business combinations. Therefore, in respect of acquisitions occurred prior to 1 January 2011 goodwill represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.</p>

<span class="th4">Subsequent measurement</span>
<p>Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Other intangible assets</span>
<p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>



<p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as license fee and is being amortised over the License period on a straight line basis.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iv)	Subsequent expenditure</span>
<p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(v)	Amortisation</span>
<p>Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:</p>

<div class="inner_figu"> 
	<ul>
    	<li>Software</li><li>3- 5 years</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<span class="th4">(f) Leased assets</span>
<p>Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. For operating leases the leased assets are not recognised on the Group's statement of financial position.</p>

<p>For operating leases, the leased assets are not recognised on the Group's statement of financial position.</p>

<span class="th4">(g) Inventories</span>
<p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle and FIFO basis on certain categories.Value of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring,conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.</p>

<span class="th4">(h)	Impairment</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Non-financial assets</span>

<p>The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.</p>

<p>The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash- generating unit"). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.</p>

<p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Financial assets</span>
<p>A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit
or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that can
be estimated reliably. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor,restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, or the disappearance of an active market for a security.</p>

<p>The Group considers evidence of impairment for receivables and held-to-maturity investment securities at both a specific asset and collective level. All individually significant receivables and held-to-maturity investment securities are as assessed for specific impairement. All individually significant receivables and held-to-maturity investment securities found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. Receievables and held-to-maturity investment securities that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together receivables and held-to-maturity investment securities with similar risk characteristics.</p>

<p>Inassessing colective impairment the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management's judgment as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends.</p>

<p>An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted
at the asset's original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against receivables. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reserved through profit or loss.</p>

<p>Impairment losses on available-for-sale investment securities are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the fair value reserve in equity, to profit or loss. The cumulative loss that is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net
of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in profit or loss. Changes in impairment provisions attributable to time value are reflected as a component of interest income.</p>

<span class="th4">(i)	Government Grants</span>
<p>Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.</p>

<span class="th4">(j)	Employee benefits</span><br />
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Defined contribution plans</span>
<p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during services is rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.</p>

<span class="th4">Employee Provident Fund</span>
<p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees' basic salary and allowances.</p>

<p>All employees of subsidiaries of the Group except for Sri Lanka Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited and SLT Services (Private) Ltd are members of Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), to which respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees' basic salary and allowances. Employees of SLT Services (Private) Ltd are members of Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), where the Company contribute 15% of such employees' basic salary and allowances.</p>


<span class="th4">Employee Trust Fund</span>
<p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees'Trust Fund.</p>
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Defined benefit plans</span>
<p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The valuation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the valuation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.</p>

<p>When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straight- line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss.</p>

<p>The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans directly in the other comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined benefit plan in personnel expense in profit or loss.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iii)	Termination benefits</span>
<p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits
as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iv)	Short-term benefits</span>
<p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.</p>

<span class="th4">(k)	Provisions</span>
<p>A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk specific to the liability. Unwinding of discount is recognised as finance cost.</p>

<span class="th4">(l)	Revenue</span>
<p>Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of trade discounts ,volume rebates and after eliminating the sales within the Group.</p>

<p>Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exist , usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.</p>

<p>If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.</p>

<p>The revenue is recognised as follows:</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Domestic and international call revenue, rental income</span>

<p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation to the period of services rendered.</p>
<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Revenue from other network operators and international settlements</span>
<p>The revenue received from other network operators, local and international, for the use of the Group's telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.</p>

<p>Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic between other telecommunications operators is recognised at the time of transit across the Group's network and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued is recognised under income in the statement of comprehensive income and interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs in the statement of comprehensive income.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic"> (iii) Revenue from broadband</span>
<p>Revenue from broadband service is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iv) Revenue from other telephony services</span>
<p>The revenue from Data services, IPTV and other telephony services are recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered between the Group and subscribers.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(v) Connection fees</span>
<p>The connection fees relating to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years based on customer churn data. Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.</p>

<p>The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the point the connection is activated.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(vi) Service Agreements revenue</span>
<p>Capacity contracts which do not convey the right to use a specified capacity in an identified fiber cable are accounted as service arrangements. Revenues from capacity contracts under service arrangements are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(vii) Prepaid Card revenue</span>
<p>Revenue from the sale of prepaid card on CDMA, Internet is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(viii)	Equipment Sales</span>
<p>Revenue from sale of equipment is recognised, net of taxes, once the equipment is delivered.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ix)	Sales of services</span>
<p>Revenue from publication sales relating to advertising revenue is recognised on publishing the advertisement on the telephone directory and a copy delivered to the subscriber on a percentage of completion method.</p>

<span class="th4">(m)	Expenditure</span>
<p>The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit for the year.</p>

<span class="th4">(n)	Lease payments</span>
<p>Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.</p>

<p>Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.</p>

<p>Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.</p>

<p>At inception of an arragement, the Group determines whether such an arragment is or contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.</p>

<span class="th4">(o)	Finance income and expenses</span>
<p>Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested (including available for sale financial assets) , dividend income, gains on the disposal of available for sale financial assets. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.</p>

<p>Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date.</p>

<p>Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis, as either finance income or finance cost depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or net loss position.</p>

<span class="th4">(p)	Income tax</span>
<p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	Current Taxation</span>
<p>Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividend.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii)	Deferred Taxation</span>
<p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax
is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>

<span class="th4">(v)	New standards and interpretations not yet adopted</span>
<p>A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early.</p>

<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(i)	SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010), SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009)</span>
<p>SLFRS 9 (2009) introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. Under SLFRS 9 (2009), financial assets are classified and measured based on the business model in which they are held and the characteristics of their contractual cash flows. SLFRS 9 (2010) introduces additions relating to financial liabilities. The IASB currently has an active project to make limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements of SLFRS 9 and add new requirements to address the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.</p>

<p>SLFRS 9 (2010 and 2009) are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of SLFRS 9 (2010) is expected to have an impact on the Group's financial assets, but not any impact on the Group's financial liabilities.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(ii) SLFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, SLFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, SLFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (2011)</span>

<p>SLFRS 10 introduces a single control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated. As a result, the Group may need to change its consolidation conclusion in respect of its investees, which may lead to changes in the current accounting for these investees. </p>

<p>Under SLFRS 11, the structure of the joint arrangement, although still an important consideration, is no longer the main factor in determining the type of joint arrangement and therefore the subsequent accounting.</p>

<p>SLFRS 12 brings together into a single standard all the disclosure requirements about an entity's interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is currently assessing the disclosure requirements for interests in subsidiaries, interests in joint arrangements and associates and unconsolidated structured entities in comparison with the existing disclosures. SLFRS 12 requires the disclosure of information about the nature, risks and financial effects of these interests.</p>

<p>These standard's effective dates have been deferred for after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.</p>


<span class="th4" style="font-style:italic">(iii) SLFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (2011)</span>
<p>SLFRS 13 provides a single source of guidance on how fair value is measured, and replaces the fair value measurement guidance that is currently dispersed throughout SLFRS. Subject to limited exceptions, SLFRS 13 is applied when fair value measurements or disclosures are required or permitted by other SLFRSs. The Group is currently reviewing its methodologies in determining fair values (see Note 5). SLFRS 13 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.</p>

<h4>4.	OPERATING SEGMENTS</h4>
<p>The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic divisions. The strategic divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors (the Chief Operating Decision Maker - CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed Telephony operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.</li>
    <li>Mobile Telephony operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.</li>
    <li>Other Segment operations includes publication & support services. None of these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable Segments in 2012 and 2011.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.</p>

<div class="inner_figu">
	<ul>
    	<li>Credit risk</li><li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Liquidity risk</li><li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Market risk</li><li>&nbsp;</li>
     </ul>
</div>     
    <p>This note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.</p>
    
    <span class="th4">Risk Management Framework</span>
    <p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.</p>
    
    <p>The Group's risk management processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.</p>
    
    <p>The Audit Committees oversee how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management processes/ guidelines and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks. The Audit Committees are assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee</p>
    
    
    <span class="th4">30. a	Credit Risk</span>
    <p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation, and arise principally from the Group's receivables from customers</p>
    
    <p>Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows;</p>
    <img src="images/118.jpg" width="660" /><br />
    
     <span class="th4">Trade and other receivables</span>
     <p>The Group has a very well established credit policy for both International Interconnect customers and Domestic customers to minimise credit risk. A separate committee has been established to evaluate and recommend the credit worthiness of the International Interconnect customers. Further prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating credit risk.</p>
     
     <p>Domestic service is offered to a new customer, only after scrutinising the internal blacklisted data base. The Group has a well- established credit control policy and process to minimise credit risk. Customers are categorised according to the segments and credit limits have been fixed as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit limit will be periodically revised as per the past monthly bill values. High risk voice customers are subjected
to automated disconnection when they reach the threshold limits. Credit control actions and recovery actions are taken for overdue customers and defaulted customers to minimise credit risk. High revenue generating customers including corporate customers are monitored individually.</p>

	<br />
    <span class="th4">Other investments</span>
    <p>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in government debt securities, repos and in short term deposits with selected bankers with Board approval.</p>
    
    <span class="th4">Guarantees</span>
    <p>Sri Lanka Telecom PLC provides corporate gurantee to its subsidiaries only.</p>
    
     <span class="th4">30. b	Liquidity Risk</span>
     
     <p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.</p>
     
     <p>The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
     
     <p>Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury division</p>
     
     <p>Repayment of the Foreign Currency borrowings of the Company has been arranged in semiannual installments avoiding any unforeseen risk on liquidity compared to a bullet repayment.</p>
     
     <p>The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest.</p><br />

     <img src="images/122.jpg" width="660" />
    
    
     <span class="th4">30.c Market Risk</span>
     <p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.</p>
     
        <span class="th4">Currency Risk</span>
     <p>The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.</p>
     <p>The summary of quantitative data about the Group's exposure to foreign currency was as follows:</p>
     <img src="images/123.jpg" width="660" />
     
  <span class="th4">Interest Rate Risk</span>   
  <p>Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest rates. The Group's borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>
  
  <p>Foreign currence borrowing at variable rate of interest or variable interest rate with a cap minimising any adverse impact due to an upward movement of USD interest rate in the market</p>
  
  <p>Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval from the board of directors</p>
