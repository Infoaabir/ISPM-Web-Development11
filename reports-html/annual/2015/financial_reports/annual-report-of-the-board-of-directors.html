<h1>Annual Report of the Board of Directors on the Affairs of the Company</h1>
		
		
			<p>The Directors are pleased to present their report and the audited Financial Statements of the Company, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC and its subsidiaries for the financial year 2015.</p>
			
			
			<h2>1. Formation </h2>
			<p>Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT ) was formed by an Incorporation Order made under Section 2 of the State Industrial Corporations Act No. 49 of 1957 and published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 596/11 of 6 February 1990. Subsequently, in terms of an order made by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications [‘the Minister’] on 24 July 1991 under Section 23 of the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 and published in the Gazette No. 675 of 9 August 1991 all properties, rights and liabilities (other than those excluded by the agreement entered into between the Minister and SLT as per sub-section 2 of Section 23 of the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act) to which the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) was entitled or subject to immediately before the transfer date of 1 September 1991 were vested with SLT.</p>
			
			<p>SLT was converted to a public limited company on 25 September 1996, under the Conversion of Public Corporations of Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Limited Companies Act No. 23 of 1987, vide Extraordinary Gazette No. 942/7 dated 25 September 1996. </p>
			
			<p>On 5 August 1997, the Government of Sri Lanka as the sole shareholder of SLT divested 35% [631,701,000 ordinary shares] of the issued ordinary share capital to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and entered into an agreement to transfer the management of SLT to NTT. Subsequently, on 2 July 1998, the Government of Sri Lanka divested a further 3.5% of the issued ordinary share capital by transfer of 63,170,010 ordinary shares to the employees of SLT. On 22 March 2000, NTT transferred the entire 35% of their holding in SLT to NTT Communications Corporation (NTT Com).</p>
			
			<p>The Government of Sri Lanka divested a further 12% of its holding to the public through a listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange in November 2002, reducing its holding to 49.5%. </p>
			
			<p>SLT was re-registered under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 as Sri Lanka Telecom PLC [SLT PLC] on 4 June 2007.</p>
			
			<p>On 1 April 2008, NTT Com of Japan who held 635,076,318 ordinary shares, which constituted 35.2% of the total issued stated capital of SLT PLC, sold their entire holding to Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V. of Netherlands (GTH) at a price of Rs. 50.50 per share. Following the share trade by NTT Com, GTH, in terms of the Takeovers and Mergers Code, announced a mandatory offer to the remaining shareholders which was closed on 2 June 2008. At the close of the mandatory offer, GTH had acquired additional 9.78% of the stated capital of SLT PLC, making the total shareholding to 44.98% of the total issued stated capital of SLT PLC.
