<h1>Corporate Governance</h1>
		
		
			<p>The Board and management of SLT Group are committed to operate in accordance with best practices in business integrity and ethics whilst maintaining the highest standards of financial reporting and Corporate Governance. The Directors believe that the Group has complied in good faith with the following steering instruments on governance throughout the year:</p>
            
            <ul class="list list-disc">
			<li>&#9;Legislations, particularly the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and the Telecommunication Act No. 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No. 27 of 1996.</li>
			<li>&#9;Company’s Articles of Association.</li>
			<li>&#9;Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange. </li>
			<li>&#9;Internal Company rules and processes and industry codes of best practices.</li>
			</ul>
			

            <img src="../images/cg_dig1.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>
<h2>  The Board of Directors</h2>
			<h3>Composition  </h3>
			
				

					
				
			
			
			<p>The Board comprises the Chairman and eight Non-Executive Directors (‘NED’), of which seven are independent Directors. The independence of the Directors was determined in accordance with the requirements of the CSE Listing Rules. The NEDs contribute valuable experience and independent judgment to the Company on business strategies, operations, technology, finance and governance. </p>
			
			<p>The two major shareholders of the Company namely the Government of Sri Lanka acting through the Secretary to the Treasury and Global Telecommunication Holdings N.V., recommend the appointment of five and four Directors respectively to the Board.  </p>
			
			<p>Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, all Directors appointed by the Board are required to be elected by the shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. A Director must also retire by rotation and seek re-election at the AGM if he or she was last elected or re-elected at an AGM held on or prior to three years before the year in question. </p>
			
			<h3>Role of the Board and conduct of its affairs  </h3>
			
				

					
				
			
			
			<p>The duty of the Board is to act in good faith in the best interests of the Group, create value for the shareholders and ensure the long-term success of the Group by focusing on the development and implementation of appropriate strategies, business models, controls and risk management processes, and management and compensation framework. </p>
			
			<p>The Board provides leadership to the Group and oversees the business affairs in terms of the corporate strategies, business plans, financial and investment plans, annual budget, financial performance as well as compliance and corporate governance practices.  The Board sets the tone for the entire Group in respect of ethics and values.</p>
			
			<p>The Group has established financial authority and approval limits for incurring operating and capital expenditure and has delegated authority for certain operational matters to the management in order to ensure efficiency. </p>
			
			<p>The Board meets on scheduled meeting dates which are agreed at the commencement of the year. The agenda for the meetings includes presentations by senior management and executives as well as external consultants or specialists where required. This allows the Board to develop a good understanding of the Group’s businesses and to promote active engagement with the senior management and executives.</p>
			
			<p>Other specific responsibilities are delegated by the Board to Sub-Committees which operate within clearly defined Terms of Reference. Details of responsibilities and operations of the Sub-Committees are provided in the following section.</p>
			
			<h3>Board Sub-Committees  </h3>
			
				

					
				
			
			
			<p>The Board considers the selection of Sub-Committee members carefully to ensure that each Sub-Committee comprises Directors with appropriate qualifications and skills, and that there is an equitable distribution of responsibilities among Directors.   </p>
			
	<p>The record of each Director’s memberships and attendance at the Board and Board Sub-Committee meetings during the financial year ended 31 December 2015 is set out on <a href="#pg28">this section</a>. </p>
