      <h2 id="mdaste">Stakeholder engagement</h2>
      <p>Given the nature and scope of its business, SLTâ€™s operations impact the lives of all Sri&nbsp;Lankans in some degree or form. Despite the vast number of stakeholders thus generated, SLT remains committed to fulfil their expectations. </p>
      <p>Different stakeholder groups have different interests, which sometimes conflict with one another. Stakeholder identification process and prioritisation is therefore essential to meet both short-term needs and long-term expectations. A systematic approach to stakeholder mapping thus forms the basis of all our interactions. The mapping process is followed by an analysis of strategies best suited in order to build relations, allocate responsibilities internally and optimise our engagement strategies.</p>

      <h2>Business model</h2>
      <p>Our business model is driven on our strategic foundations built on delivering world class ICT services, transforming and modernising operational architecture, transforming to a next generation network and strengthening Group synergy.</p>
      <p>It supports our goal to deliver value to our shareholders, customers and the society.</p>
      <p>The communications market is very competitive in Sri&nbsp;Lanka. Customers have choices as and when they need. </p>
      <p>We are very confident that we have a unique combination of people, brand, networks and technology.</p>
      <p>To realise our goal, overall investment the Group has made throughout its entire 150-year span is enormous in terms of magnitude. The SLT Group has invested over USD 1.3 billion in telecommunication service provisioning since coming under the BOI umbrella in 2007. Investments made by SLT towards the country for a period of over 150 years have placed Sri&nbsp;Lanka as well as our countryâ€™s entire ICT sector at the forefront of the region by facilitating multi-faceted ICT solutions to the nation, and helping to increase its strategic geographical advantage. We are indeed humbled by the confidence placed in us by the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka and the Board of Investment of Sri&nbsp;Lanka. In that sense â€˜Investing for the futureâ€™ is always at the heart of the way SLT Group runs the business.</p>
      <p>Since obtaining BOI approval in 2007, SLT has invested in excess of Rs. 57 billion/USD 485 million to improve the countryâ€™s telecommunication infrastructure, encompassing the expansion of multi-faceted national ICT infrastructures: Internet Data Centre (IDCs), Voice Services, Enterprise and Wholesale Services, High Speed Broadband Services, PEO TV expansion, Fibre Optic Network expansion, 4G LTE expansion, International Connectivity, Fibre to the Home (FTTH) and Wi-Fi Wireless Broadband projects.</p>
      <h2>Group goals and strategies</h2>
      <h3>National goals</h3>
      <p>As a business undertaking with a significant State shareholding, SLT shares in and contributes to national economic and social goals as outlined by Government in policy. In 2013, these were:</p>

        <li>IT literacy target: 90% by 2020</li>
        <li>SMART Sri&nbsp;Lanka and digital economy concept </li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h2>Financial review</h2>
      <h3>Revenue</h3>
      <p>Revenue at Group level reached Rs. 65.04 billion, a 8% growth, primarily driven by mobile voice, broadband, wholesale and enterprise data. At Company level, SLT experienced a noteworthy increase in revenue mainly driven by broadband, wholesale and enterprise data, and international revenue. SLT revenue has increased to Rs. 38.95 billion in 2014 from Rs. 36.78 billion in 2013, recording a growth of 6%. Subscriber numbers experienced an upward curve of 6% in both wire-line and CDMA. Even though there was a decline in the voice revenue as expected, non-traditional revenue lines including broadband, wholesale, enterprise data and PEO TV recorded significant growth levels.</p>
      <img src="images/graphs/mda1.jpg" class="img-responsive dont_float" >
      <h3>Expenditure</h3>
      <p>The operating cost was up by 12% for the Group mainly due to the out of court settlement of Rs. 673 million and a Rs. 518 million obsolescence of network equipment. Overall, the cost was prudently managed by the management.</p>
      <img src="images/graphs/mda2.jpg" class="img-responsive dont_float" > <img src="images/graphs/mda3.jpg" class="img-responsive dont_float" > <img src="images/graphs/mda4.jpg" class="img-responsive dont_float" >
      <h3>Profitability</h3>
      <p>The Group recorded a Profit before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 8.25 billion in 2014 compared to Rs. 7.36 billion in 2013. This was an increase of 12%. The Profit after Tax for the year was Rs. 6.00 billion in 2014 compared to Rs. 5.42 billion in 2013, an increase of 11%. Enhanced turnover, prudent management of operational costs and favourable impacts from non-operational activities resulted in significant increase in profit for the year under review. </p>
      <p>At Company level, SLT posted a PBT of Rs. 4.86 billion, a marginal decrease of 3% from the previous year and a Profit after Tax for the year of Rs. 3.3 billion, a decrease of 9% when compared to 2013. The main reason for this drop was due to the out of court settlement of Rs. 673 million paid out during the year.</p>
      <img src="images/graphs/mda5.jpg" class="img-responsive dont_float" >
      <h3>Interest cover</h3>

      <h2>Review of operations</h2>
      <p>Worldwide and at home, our industry is in a state of continuous transition. Companies like Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom must constantly reinvent themselves to remain competitive and relevant. The challenge is immense, yet SLT has shown itself more than equal to it. Leveraging opportunities created by the changing landscape and the national policy framework, our Group remains both the market and a technological leader in its sector.</p>
      <p>Today, SLT provides ICT solutions to most connected Sri&nbsp;Lankan businesses, including Business Today top 25 companies, LMD top 100 companies, Colombo Stock Exchange listed companies and nearly all connected public-sector institutions. This pervasive presence means that our contribution to the national economy is, in reality, much higher than is indicated purely by our own revenue and tax figures. Essentially, we are in the business of helping others build business and increase their revenues.</p>
      <p>Our recent investment in the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, a ultra-fast, high-capacity international cable system that will connect Southeast Asia with the Middle East and Western Europe, will not only boost Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s international connectivity, creating a plethora of opportunities for citizens and businesses, but will also give us â€˜full landingâ€™ status, meaning that Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s connections with the world will now be direct, not through a branch of the cable system as was previously the case. This will increase our attractiveness as a destination for BPO and data centre operations. The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable station is now being established at Matara. </p>
      <p>In the year under review, we also contributed to national transformation and pride by becoming the preferred ICT solutions partner for a number of Government â€˜mega-projectsâ€™. We also implemented new ICT solutions for universities (we recently upgraded the LEARN university network), the Governmentâ€™s own ICT network and â€˜e-governmentâ€™ programme, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Police CCTV project expansion and many others.</p>
      <h3>Operating environment</h3>
      <h4>Global</h4>
      <p>The biggest trend in telecommunications in 2014, as it has been for some years now, was the rapid expansion of online networks and services. According to a report published by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), some 2.9 billion people or 40% of the global population were online by the end of 2014. If this rate of growth continues, half the worldâ€™s population will be online by 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the same authority, mobile phone subscriptions were estimated to exceed 6.9 billion worldwide by the end of 2014 â€“ a connection for almost every person on the planet. Three-quarters of these subscriptions were in the developing world and over half in the Asia-Pacific region. By the end of 2019, says the ITU, there may be 5.6 billion smartphone subscriptions.</p>
      <p>These are exciting figures. They reveal opportunities for substantial growth and foretell energetic competition as telecom firms jostle for the largest possible piece of the pie. Around the world, telecom authorities and firms are boosting the roll-out and deployment of broadband networks and services to position themselves and their countries for future competitiveness in a growing digital economy. There is widespread recognition that broadband networks and services are more than simple infrastructure â€“ they represent a set of transformative technologies that are changing the way we communicate, the ways in which we work, play and do business.</p>
      <p>The ITU has set some global broadband goals for its members. Broadly, these are:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Drafting and adopting a universal broadband policy </li>
        <li>Making broadband affordable </li>
        <li>Connecting homes to broadband </li>
        <li>Getting people online </li>
        <li>Achieving gender equality in access to broadband by 2020</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a member of the ITU and a signatory to its protocols, Sri&nbsp;Lanka, too, is committed to these goals. More specifically, SLT is committed to the Connect 2020 Agenda for Global Telecommunication/ICT Development, which was unanimously adopted at the ITU 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference. The agenda specifies concrete goals and objectives in a number of areas ranging from cyber-security to the cost of online services to the creation of a gender-neutral internet. More information on the Connect 2020 agenda can be found at the ITU website (see http://ww.itu.int/pp14).</p>
      <p>While new technologies are expected to drive telecoms growth, and in particular ICT and broadband growth, vast investments in legacy systems around the world cannot be written off overnight. Thus, copper-based technologies (DSL, ADSL and ADSL2+) still predominate around the world, though fibre continues to outpace all other access types in new deployments. Fibre-based technologies, which include VDSL and VDSL2, now enjoy global overall growth rates of 17.6%.</p>
      <p>This worldwide picture of technological transformation is also reflected in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p>
      <h4>Local</h4>
      <p>Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s economic performance during the past few years has followed the positive trend of emerging economies in the region thanks to a series of well-timed macroeconomic interventions to stimulate growth and reinforce stability. Growth was also fuelled by a gradual easing of national monetary policy from mid-2013 onwards. Seeking to build a firm credit appetite among private-sector investors, the Central Bank of Sri&nbsp;Lanka further eased interest rates in the latter part of the year. The looser regime helped foster a healthy level of credit growth among private-sector companies. </p>

      <p>Continuing with the trend of the past few years, inflation remained at single-digit levels. According to the Central Bank, average inflation over the past 65 months was 5.9%.</p>
      <p>Combined mobile and fixed-line telephony penetration in Sri&nbsp;Lanka is now 100% - a magnificent achievement for a country that, barely a generation ago, was struggling to offer widespread voice connectivity beyond major urban centres and trunk roads. But we have moved far beyond voice. Today, Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s Network Readiness Index (NRI) is equal to Indiaâ€™s â€“ the highest in the region. The country also enjoys some of the lowest call and data charges in the world, making it highly attractive to businesses that rely on connectivity to function. Unsurprisingly, Sri&nbsp;Lanka was named â€˜outsourcing destination of the yearâ€™ in 2012-2013 by the UK National Outsourcing Association and was ranked among the top 25 global outsourcing destinations by A.T. Kearney in 2011. The IT/BPO sector has experienced tremendous growth in the past few years and is now one of the countryâ€™s top five export industries. There are now over three hundred IT, BPO and KPO companies in Sri&nbsp;Lanka, employing more than 60,000 people.</p>
      <p>With economic growth likely to continue in the long term, demand for the services provided by SLT and its subsidiaries can only increase. However, meeting the demand will call for extraordinary efforts in such areas as technological innovation and adoption, increasing access to services, making services affordable, relevant and customer-friendly, and optimising revenue streams.</p>
      <h3>Business operations</h3>
      <h4>Global connectivity</h4>
      <p>Not content with being Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s leading telecom company, SLT is aggressively pursuing new markets in the region. Building international connectivity is a key aspect of this strategy. SLTâ€™s global coverage was significantly strengthened via undersea optical fibre links: SEA-ME-WE 3, SEA-ME-WE 4, Bharat-Lanka (between India and Sri&nbsp;Lanka) and Dhiraagu (between Maldives and Sri&nbsp;Lanka). Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s geographical location makes it a natural nexus for communications in the Indian Ocean basin and helps ensure that the country plays a key role in the process of unfolding new technologies across the region.</p>
      <p>We report below on a number of international connectivity-related projects.</p>
      <h5>Upgrade of the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable</h5>
      <p>Commissioned in 2005, the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable system is an ultra-high-capacity fibre-optic submarine cable system linking South-East Asia to Western Europe via the Middle East. Utilising linear and ring-fibre network architecture, this 18,000 km cable is equipped with a total of 16 landing stations. The SEA-ME-WE 4 cable network is owned by a consortium of 17 leading telecom carriers from 15 countries. </p>
      <p>SLT has developed important partnerships through its involvement in this project. Key among them are the relationships forged with near neighbours Bharti Infotel and Tata Communications (India) and Dhiraagu (Maldives). </p>
      <p>Following a 2013 upgrade by SLT that enabled the system to accommodate speeds of up to 100Gbps, the cable again became available for commercial use at the end of 2014. </p>
      <h5>Capacity for future growth: SEA-ME-WE-5</h5>
      <p>SLT is also a member of the 19-member international consortium that owns and is currently in the process of implementing yet another important connectivity project, the SEA-ME-WE 5 international undersea cable system. With a total design capacity of 24Tbps, this 20,000km cable runs from Singapore to France and has a total of 16 landing stations. Construction of the cable commenced in September 2014. When it is finished in 2016, SEA-ME-WE 5 will deliver a massive increase in communications capacity, which will be available to support growth in Sri&nbsp;Lanka and other member countries. </p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix2.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>The ambitious Sri&nbsp;Lankan sector of the project entails building a double landing station at Matara. The landing stations for SMW4 and SMW3 are located at Colombo and Mount Lavinia respectively.</p>
      <h4>Building and upgrading national infrastructure</h4>
      <p>SLT is more than simply the leading telecoms service provider in Sri&nbsp;Lanka; it is responsible for creating and maintaining the physical telecommunications infrastructure of the nation. This function, whose historical origins lie in SLTâ€™s former incarnation as the incumbent telecom partner has greatly broadened and diversified in the decades since privatisation. Besides its obvious competitive advantage, being the national infrastructure provider is also an awesome responsibility - one of which we are always conscious, and seek to meet the utmost standards of technical and professional excellence in fulfilling.</p>
      <p>Our ongoing network modernisation and transformation project, which consists of the Next Generation Network (NGN) project and the i-Sri&nbsp;Lanka programme, is bringing ultra-high-speed broadband coverage, together with a host of IP-based services, to existing network users all over the country. Currently, SLT internet services are delivered via the nationwide fibre-optic backbone using a variety of access technologies: copper-based PSTN (Megaline), FTTC (i-Sri&nbsp;Lanka), FTTB (Metro Ethernet), LTE, Wi-Fi and Corporate VPN (Intelligent Solutions).</p>
      <p>Recent achievements in this area include the roll-out of Fibre to the home (FTTH) services in urban areas, which commenced in April 2014, and the extension of ICT and broadband services to Delft Island, 32 km off the coast of Jaffna, in October 2014.</p>
      <p>We report below on some of our national infrastructure-related projects.</p>
      <h5>National backbone network</h5>
      <p>The Government awarded Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom the role of  â€˜national backbone network service providerâ€™ for Sri&nbsp;Lanka in 2013. Under this license, SLT will provide the fibre-optic â€˜backboneâ€™ for the national communications network, which will cover all 329 administrative divisions of the country within five years. The first phase of this project, completed in 2014, consisted of a new generation OTN-based 100G DWDM solution delivering 8Tb of capacity. This world-class transport and backbone network facilitates the full range of broadband access technologies, including ADSL2+, VDSL2, FTTx, carrier-grade Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE, with download speeds of up to 100Mbps, which is ultra-fast.</p>
      <h5>Next generation network</h5>
      <p>In parallel with our efforts to extend and improve the national communications backbone, SLT is working to transform the entire national communications network into a full-fledged â€˜Next Generationâ€™ Network (NGN) capable of handling massive amounts of data at super-fast speeds with maximal data integrity. This ongoing project commenced in 2011. The chart below shows progress to date:</p>
      <p><img src="images/graphs/mda11.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <h5>i-Sri&nbsp;Lanka project</h5>
      <p>An ambitious project intended to facilitate unlimited network access at unprecedented speeds with minimal disruption, i-Sri&nbsp;Lanka currently leverages FTTC, FTTB and FTTH technologies to extend connectivity via multi-service access nodes located in close proximity to the desired location. In the future, however, switching between multiple mechanisms will be eliminated by a more efficient soft switching structure accommodated by a single-platform operational system. </p>
      <p>FTTH connectivity supports download speeds of up to 100Mbps currently, increasing the reliability and quality of broadband data while significantly reducing maintenance and replacement costs. Having commenced deployment in 2010, the i-Sri&nbsp;Lanka project is expected to be completed by end 2015. The project has important environmental impacts, including a space saving of 8,500 sq.ft. and monthly energy savings of some Rs. 70 million till end 2013.</p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix3.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>Our efforts to improve the national communications infrastructure benefit all Sri&nbsp;Lankans. They also, necessarily, benefit all service providers â€“ our competitors as well as ourselves. However, SLT is ideally placed to leverage its competitive advantage as infrastructure provider by taking the lead in rolling out new services for customers based on added capacity and next-generation technologies. These aspects of our operations are discussed below.</p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix4.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <h5>Fibre to the home (FTTH)</h5>
      <p>While FTTC and FTTB technologies are available to all users in a neighbourhood or building, fibre to the home technology is a benefit enjoyed only by SLT fixed-line customers. In 2014, we continued to roll out VDSL2, ADSL2+ and FTTH, simultaneously enhancing customersâ€™ experience and investing in the future. More than half a million households are already connected to SLTâ€™s broadband services; our effort now is to provide all of them with FTTH, the worldâ€™s most reliable connectivity option.</p>
      <h5>SLT broadband services</h5>
      <p>At the beginning of the year under review, we introduced data-volume enhancements at no extra cost to customers. We also further expanded our broadband portfolio, enabling customers to choose packages offering speeds ranging from 2-16Mbps and monthly data volumes from 2.5-375GB.</p>
      <p>We were proud to see Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s ranking in the Global Network Readiness Index advance by three places, while the country continues to offer the worldâ€™s lowest-priced entry-level broadband services among countries where broadband is growing quickly.</p>
      <h5>Metro ethernet</h5>
      <p>SLT Metro Ethernet delivers high-bandwidth connectivity for high-rises, large corporate offices and important commercial buildings. It is based on the well-known Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) standard and offers capacity and reliability in the demanding arena of data communications for enterprises. </p>
      <p>The SLT Metro Ethernet network connects most important commercial locations in metropolitan areas, including cities outside Colombo. A new aggregation network was introduced in 2014 for improved service availability.</p>
      <h5>Enterprise solutions (Intelligent solutions)</h5>
      <p>Our enterprise customers now enjoy a wide array of product offerings in our Intelligent Solutions portfolio. Exclusively offered to corporate customers, the portfolio includes managed, networking, hosting and enterprise voice services. </p>
      <h5>Carrier-grade Wi-Fi </h5>
      <p>We continued to expand our public Wi-Fi hotspot service using next generation wireless broadband access technology, widening the countryâ€™s broadband footprint and improving internet access for all Sri&nbsp;Lankans on line. The project aims to create a series of carrier grade Wi-Fi hotspots at strategic locations across the country. By facilitating seamless mobile offloading and roaming for SLT broadband customers, these Wi-Fi hotspots are expected to provide wider access for the SLT Groupâ€™s fixed and mobile broadband subscribers, thereby helping to increase our customer acquisition and retention rate in direct correlation to the growth in the number of hotspots across the country.</p>
      <h5>ADSL2+ to VDSL2</h5>
      <p>Following our launch of advanced VDSL2 fixed-line broadband technology in September 2013, we have continued to replace ADSL2+ technology with VDSL2 across an ever-widening swathe of our network, delivering connection speeds of up to 100Mbps to broadband subscribers.</p>
      <h5>Fixed 4G LTE</h5>
      <p>We also introduced another broadband technology, fixed 4G LTE, with a demonstration at the Dr. N.M. Perera Memorial Hall, Ruwanwella, Kegalle in January 2014. Download speeds of up to 50Mbps were attained at the demonstration. The Company enhanced its broadband delivery capacity with the addition of a LTE platform. It allows to engage in the competition head-on with three complementary fixed broadband platforms of DSL, FTTX ad LTE.</p>
      <h5>Cloud computing</h5>
      <p>Launched in March 2014 at an SLT customer forum for Government institutions at Waterâ€™s Edge, Battaramulla, SLTâ€™s breakthrough cloud computing service, akaza, provides end-to-end enterprise services that offer enterprise customers, Government Departments, SMEs and micro-enterprises the advantages of enhanced agility, quick service delivery and cost efficiencies while providing (â€™in-house ITâ€™ teams) maximum ROI and improved scalability. </p>
      <p>The akaza product was developed in collaboration with Citrix Systems, a global leader in cloud services, mobile workspaces, virtualisation, mobility management and networking. It offers ICT infrastructure, data archiving and operations, development platforms, working desktops, software and communications as â€˜servicesâ€™, meaning that organisations no longer need to invest in infrastructure to provide these capabilities for themselves. The deployment of akaza is made possible by SLTâ€™s state-of-the-art broadband infrastructure, which facilitates high-quality, uninterrupted, high-speed data communications â€“ the single most important criterion for successful cloud-computing deployment. For users, akaza eliminates the need to invest in expensive servers, data centres, software and IT experts, freeing them to focus their capital and energies on what they do best. It is particularly useful for SMEs and micro enterprises for whom capital costs have hitherto limited access to these facilities. </p>

      <h4>Major ICT infrastructure development in North and East</h4>
      <p>Since 2010 the expansion of our fibre-optic core network to the Northern Peninsula via the A9 main route was completed. This includes; improving customer access to high performance broadband, empowering business expansion, enabling all telecommunications operators to expand their operations, enhanced quality, performance and capacity to meet all future ICT requirements of the Northern Peninsula. Development spreads widely across the land, from north to east, south to west, bringing with it employment, growth, income and investment that will naturally follow in its wake.</p>
      <p>With SLT having embarked on massive network modernisation and expansion projects, the Companyâ€™s fibre roll-out is comprehensive, with its fibre-optic transmission network now covering most parts of the island, including rural areas and the North and the East; thus enabling the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka to choose SLT as the preferred NBN partner in the light of achieving its goals for economic development, with broadband penetration being a key element in its strategy towards such development.</p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix13.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <h5>Looking forward</h5>
      <p>In Sri&nbsp;Lanka, as elsewhere, the impact of ICT has been enormous and transformative. We see, more and more, that customers are moving away from traditional voice communications to non-voice enabled products. In keeping with this trend, SLT is now implementing a Rs. 25 billion investment plan that will help upgrade and future-proof our infrastructure and service offering. Our business strategy calls for heavy investment in new technologies such as LTE, carrier-grade Wi-Fi, cloud computing and the national fibre backbone. Many Colombo homes and businesses now enjoy direct fibre-optic connections. Our aims are to offer more IP-based services, invest in national IT infrastructure and enhance the customer experience at every touch point, both offline and online.</p>
      <p>SLTâ€™s investments in carrier-grade wireless technology and fibre-optic architecture leave us well placed to capture significant synergies in the longer term. We can now provide an integrated menu of voice, networking, data-hosting, managed and cloud-computing services to our customers. By thus providing integrated solutions for large companies while simultaneously supporting the growing SME segment and the public sector through extensive broadband connectivity, we support the nationâ€™s economic progress at all levels, seamlessly and synergistically. </p>

      <p>Mobitel (Private) Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom, accounted for 47% of SLT Group revenue in 2014. Mobitel offers Mobile telephony, high-speed broadband, enterprise solutions, IDD and a host of value-added services with island-wide coverage. Mobitel was the first operator in South Asia to launch a super 3.5G network, the first to make a successful demonstration of HSPA+MIMO technology and the first to trial 4G/LTE technology successfully. The recent introduction of Dual Carrier HSPA+ technology and 4G-LTE service makes Mobitelâ€™s broadband service the fastest in the country. International roaming is available with over 400 networks worldwide. With USD 500 million - worth of investments made to date, Mobitel has played an important part in shaping Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s ICT landscape, and presently boasts a customer base of over 5 million.</p>
      <p>The following is a review of the activities of our largest subsidiary:</p>
      <h4>Chief Executive Officerâ€™s statement</h4>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix14.jpg" class="img-responsive do_float"></p>
      <p>Customers are becoming increasingly tech-savvy, knowledgeable and sophisticated. Their requirements are expanding faster than technology â€“ driving innovation in the market. In this milieu, service providers are expected to keep up with the demand through continuous improvement, innovation and enhanced service delivery.</p>
      <p>To cater to the evolving customer needs we have embraced an all encompassing customer centric approach. We have set a benchmark for exceptional customer service standards which gives us an unparalleled edge in the market. Our ability to respond to customer demands effectively and efficiently is enabled due to the adoption of right technologies at the right time. We have built a formidable ICT infrastructure and introduced a host of new technologies and tech-based services to Sri&nbsp;Lankan consumers.</p>
      <p>As part of our customer centric approach, we focused more on regional markets, particularly in the North and the East of the country where our presence earlier was not strong. Our operations in Jaffna were radically upgraded this year. In other parts of country, too, we provided services that are precisely in tune with local demand. </p>
      <p>This year special emphasis was placed on Mobitelâ€™s regional approach in the market. Integration of sales, marketing and network operations on a regional basis was implemented with the aim of achieving the company objectives more effectively. Additional resources were allocated to areas where Mobitel is lagging behind in market share compared to competition.</p>
      <p>These efforts have paid off. The year under review saw Mobitel achieve its highest-ever revenues since inception. We have grown faster than the industry, acquired market share and built on success.</p>
      <p>Internally preparations were made during the year for the implementation of a world class performance management system at Mobitel in consultation with a global leader in HR consulting. The system aims to transform Mobitel into a transparent, performance-driven enterprise where employees are rewarded solely on merit. Other structural changes are also in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>I believe these changes will make us a more dynamic and competitive Company in a saturating voice market where broadband and wireless technologies have catapulted the communication landscape. However, generating meaningful revenues from OTT services such as Skype, Viber and WhatsApp will remain a challenge as these data services offer little value to the service provider. However, with high calibre of people with us and the changes we have now put in place, I am confident that Mobitel will continue to grow and prosper in the years to come.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Financial review</h4>
      <p>During the year under review, Mobitel excelled in all key areas of the business. Mobitel reported the highest profits in its history recording a profit of Rs. 2.8 billion. This profit was achieved as a joint result of 11% growth in revenue over previous year coupled with cost efficiencies obtained through well-managed cost structure. In absolute terms, Mobitel crossed the Rs. 30 billion milestone to record a sales turnover of Rs. 30.60 billion in 2014 compared to Rs. 27.48 billion in 2013, an increase of Rs. 3.12 billion â€“ an improvement ahead of industry.</p>
      <p><img src="images/graphs/mda13.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>Despite voice market in Sri&nbsp;Lanka nearing saturation, growth in voice segment continued in 2014 as well with increase in both revenue and subscribers. Increase in international services, roaming and data services also contributed towards the growth in revenue. Mobitelâ€™s continuous commitment and investments towards scaling and upgrading its network infrastructure have resulted in better customer experience which in turn boosts revenues for the Company. Revenue was further fuelled by Mobitelâ€™s Strong Brand that offers its customers a wide range of products and services through the comprehensive distribution channels developed through the years. Considerable investment in latest and timely upgrades in broadband technologies such as 3G and 4G paid off during the year with a notable increase in broadband revenues compared to 2013. Data has taken a lead role as the new growth driver of the Company recording strong performance. </p>
      <p><img src="images/graphs/mda14.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>A growth trend similar to that of revenue continues across the Companyâ€™s profitability indicators with EBITDA growing by 8% recording Rs. 9.8 billion and EBIT growing by 12% recording Rs. 4.0 billion. The strong growth in EBITDA and EBIT can be attributed to prudent cost management initiatives coupled with measures to enhance productivity. For year 2014 Mobitel reported an after tax profit of Rs. 2.82 billion as against Rs. 2.44 billion in financial year 2013, recording a 15% improvement. The growth in profits was achieved despite one off write off on Mobitel network assets amounting to Rs. 601.8 million. The increase in profitability is attributable to optimum asset utilisation and increased productivity along with the prudent initiatives undertaken during preceding years having an impact on the performance of year 2014. The favourable macro environment with reduced interest rates, lower inflation and stability in exchange rate also favoured the improvement in net profit.</p>

      <p><img src="images/graphs/mda16.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <h4>Business performance</h4>
      <p>Reaching critical mass and capturing a substantial portion of core voice business has been decisive for Mobitelâ€™s growth thus far, but voice business, although necessary, will not deliver future growth. Instead, market growth and retention will hinge on the Companyâ€™s ability to bring the latest mobile technologies to the markets it serves. To this end, Mobitel is investing aggressively in broadband technology and services, as discussed later in this review.</p>
      <p>The Company continued to reinforce its market position in 2014, expanding reach, strengthening its position in existing markets and focusing on new niches with customised products and solutions. In an industry where competition has grown so intense that mere survival is a challenge even for leading players, Mobitel continued to gain ground and improve its sales performance. Following on from a commendable performance in 2013, the Company achieved sales turnover of Rs. 30.6 billion in the year under review â€“ a gain of Rs. 3.1 billion or 11% over last yearâ€™s figures.</p>
      <p>Business from voice services was still the main contributor to overall sales performance, with broadband and other services following. Despite the near-saturation of the market, Mobitel market share continued to increase in 2014 due to enhanced reach, value offerings, service innovations and effective marketing. Broadband (internet) services also reported positive growth; Mobitel will focus strongly on this area in the future.</p>
      <p>Improved sales performance and cost efficiencies significantly increased EBITDA in 2014. Stable macroeconomic conditions such as moderate inflation and lower borrowing costs contributed significantly towards profitability. Mobitel also enjoys the advantage of strong asset-utilisation and a well-managed cost structure.</p>

      <h4>Review of operations</h4>
      <h5>Operating environment</h5>
      <p>The Sri&nbsp;Lankan mobile communications sub-sector has developed rapidly in terms of size and technology. As regards technological sophistication, it is comparable with that of any advanced country. Investment by several competing operators has spread mobile networks across the length and breadth of Sri&nbsp;Lanka and mobile subscribers at present exceed 20 million in number â€“ close to the entire population. Approximately a fifth of these are multi-SIM users. In terms of penetration, the market is approaching saturation point.</p>
      <p>Though voice services continue to drive industry revenue, it is widely acknowledged that broadband demand will fuel future revenue growth. However, the speed and cost of technological change is a challenge for any operator, particularly in the broadband space. Market size and share become key considerations when evaluating the likely profitability of future investments. If the necessary investments in data technology are to be made, some industry consolidation is inevitable. Having the second-largest market share in the sector and currently enjoying perhaps the best EBITDA margin in the industry, Mobitel is well-placed to further strengthen its industry position and give life to its vision of making Sri&nbsp;Lanka a knowledge-rich infocomm society.</p>
      <h4>Business operations</h4>
      <h5>Market acquisition and retention</h5>
      <p>Building on natural growth in usage, voice services were promoted through carefully planned and executed marketing plans and promotions. The Cash Bonanza promotion campaign for subscribers had brought impressive improvements to acquisition and recharge figures when relaunched in 2013 targeting pre-paid subscribers. Its success with this segment prompted an extension of the promotion to post-paid and broadband subscribers in 2014, and 374,229 lucky winners received a total of Rs. 150 million in cash rewards during the course of the year in daily, monthly and quarterly draws. Coupled with Cash Bonanza, the company also launched a successful promotional offer in which subscribers received a bundle of value-added voice, SMS and data services worth Rs. 300/- on their first recharge. Many other customer-directed marketing and promotional campaigns, local and national, planned and ad hoc, supported Mobitel brand and services in 2014.</p>
      <p>One step up the marketing chain, the Company launched an incentive programme for sub-dealers, whose position at the retail interface makes them especially influential with customers.</p>
      <p>Mobitelâ€™s share of corporate voice and data services also grew, largely as a result of intense company activity targeting this segment. The specialist unit dedicated to developing innovative applications and enterprise solutions was further strengthened; its focus was to build the reality and perception of Mobitel as an extension of the business processes of its corporate customers. The results have been encouraging in terms of new-businesses as well as in generating increased data and voice traffic from present customers. The focus on corporate services offers great promise for the future.</p>
      <p>The Company successfully developed and launched a range of specialised product offerings and value-added services to suit various market niches. Building on insights and experience gained with the Upahara subscriber package for Government employees and pensioners, Mobitel introduced a new package for pensioners, Kalaguna, in 2014. This post-paid package, designed to address the special needs of more than half a million Government pensioners, includes a free mobile phone, a post-paid user package including free voice, and a range of value-added services including the mCash service.</p>
      <p>Another example of Mobitel innovation is mLottery, a value-added service that allows subscribers to participate in Development Lotteries Board sweepstakes through their mobile phones using an automated, voice-guided application.</p>
      <p>The Companyâ€™s focus on expanding market share in the North and East of the country was reflected in the relocation and upgrading of its Jaffna branch, which is now a full-fledged â€˜customer experience centreâ€™. Visitors can try out (and purchase) the latest mobile technologies on the market, including 3G, 4G LTE, and check out the newest smartphones, tabs and data services. A decentralised call centre was also set up to serve Tamil-speaking customers.</p>
      <h5>Business solutions</h5>
      <p>We took a platform-based approach to develop modular enterprise solutions for businesses and Government departments. These solutions deliver enhanced efficiency, cost savings and process improvements irrespective of organisation size or nature of business. The year under review saw some noteworthy successes in this area.</p>
      <p>Mobitel extended â€˜Mobitel One fuel cardâ€™ solution to Dilmah, a leading tea exporter, to improve administrative efficiency, speed and convenience. The product is a stored-value card, which replaces the manual fuel-allowance management system used by most companies. Mobitel One allows real-time monitoring of fuel transactions by the cardholder as well as his or her supervisors and other authorised personnel at Dilmah.</p>
      <p>The Company also collaborated with Cinnamon Hotels on an automated guest check-in/check-out system for the latterâ€™s new city hotel, Cinnamon Red. The system saves time and improves convenience.</p>
      <p>Another Mobitel platform, mHealth, facilitates data and voice services such as mChanneling â€“ a consultant-appointment service, successfully tested at Dompe Hospital during the year under review.</p>
      <p>In a coming development, Mobitel has been named exclusive technology provider for the Royal College Unionâ€™s loyalty programme, Floreat. The RCU, which is probably the largest alumni organisation in Sri&nbsp;Lanka, will use Mobitelâ€™s Loyalty Card platform to run the Floreat programme, which offers Union members discounts from leading merchants and institutions.</p>
      <h5>Roaming and IDD</h5>
      <p>A flat-fee data roaming plan for selected countries was introduced in 2014, eliminating bill shocks for customers. Post-paid customers were also offered a deposit-free roaming plan based on their usual credit limits. The year also saw the launch of LTE Roaming in collaboration with StarHub, a Singaporean telco.</p>
      <p>The year also saw the launch of an in-flight data roaming plan for the added convenience of frequent business travellers. Using the plan, Mobitel post-paid customers can browse the web for as little as Rs. 65/- per MB while in the air, receiving usage notifications on their mobile phones for added convenience. The service is currently available on SriLankan, British Airways, Etihad, Emirates, Oman Air, Philippine Airlines, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, Saudi Airlines and Singapore Airlines flights, with more carriers expected to sign up in 2015.</p>
      <p>In response to an opportunity identified in the Ja-elaâ€“Chilaw belt, Mobitel designed a special SIM pack that offers special pricing for IDD calls to Italy. The success of the product encouraged Mobitel to introduce similar plans, including IDD calls to South Korea.</p>
      <h4>Network and technology development</h4>
      <p>As the National Mobile Service Operator, Mobitel assumes the role of the information and communication powerhouse of the country. The Company employs the brightest available local technical talent and consciously invests in their development in terms of technical as well as managerial skills. The formation and use of cross-functional teams across all aspects of the business has been of great significance to the Companyâ€™s success from thought to conceptualising to giving life to thought. This competency edge of the Company allows it to continuously value innovate and deliver superior solutions whether mass market or unique customised products, platforms or solutions.</p>
      <p>Supported by this great reservoir of technical prowess, led by good foresight and vision, and fortified by the guidance and power of a strong parent, Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom PLC, Mobitel has over the years deployed state-of-the-art technology that have been regularly upgraded, adapted and scaled-up to offer cutting edge world class technology and products to Sri&nbsp;Lanka. Also, as the National Mobile Service Operator, Mobitel also assumes a higher responsibility to support the countryâ€™s broader vision of transforming Sri&nbsp;Lanka into a knowledge hub of Asia.</p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix15.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>A large part of the Companyâ€™s success could be attributed to its understanding of the local market and an ability to swiftly respond to the new and growing market needs. Whilst expanding its 2G and 3G network coverage with the basic subscribers in mind, Mobitel is also fast-tracking its 4G technology and value added products and services deployment that offer new experiences to the sophisticated, trendy and tech savvy subscribers. The Company is ably assisting the corporate sector to improve efficiencies and productivity, cost savings, product development etc., towards becoming world-class, and above all Mobitel is partnering with the private and public sectors of the country as well as global partners to build an ICT infrastructure that has the capacity break through many frontiers and fuel Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™s march forward to become a leading Asian Nation.</p>
      <p>A noteworthy initiative undertaken during the course of the year was the development of an GPS-enabled ultrasonic sensor for monitoring vehicle fuel consumption and relay the data in real time to a mobile device. The Company expects considerable interest in this new technology from fleet and transport managers, bus and taxi companies, etc.</p>
      <h5>Broadband</h5>
      <p>Mobitel continued to roll out 4G LTE technology in 2014, focusing on key cities and high-end customer locations. As 3G and 4G networks expand, they drive the uptake of internet-based services, particularly business services. Building on this, the Company tailored its service offerings to consumer demand with specialised app packages for social networking, email and video, and collaborated with service providers such as ikman.lk to provide even more benefits to customers.</p>
      <p>With smart devices growing in popularity, it is clear that Wi-Fi will be a key driver of future data-service growth. In 2014, Mobitel embarked on a strategy of deploying carrier-grade Wi-Fi networks in high-demand locations such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and universities. Action to promote Wi-Fi solutions to the enterprise market were an integral part of this strategy.</p>
      <p>An interesting special project in this area was the launch of free Wi-Fi services at the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) in Kandy. These include access to an informative online guide for tourists visiting the temple. An interactive voice guide (with several languages to choose from) accompanies visitors as they explore each part of the temple. The Company hopes to replicate this application, duly modified, in other places of significance.</p>
      <p>The biggest consumers of internet services are smartphone users, the majority of whom are pre-paid users. Aware that most lower-income users opt for pre-paid internet plans, the Company introduced several entry-level plans, some of which allow users to start experiencing the internet for as little as three Rupees. Mobitel also plans to leverage increasing smartphone penetration by partnering with several device distributors in Sri&nbsp;Lanka to offer internet products bundled with smart devices. An additional advantage is that these distributors also become part of Mobitelâ€™s channel network. Social media packs are included in these data packages to promote broadband usage.</p>
      <h5>Platform development</h5>
      <p>The many platforms developed and others under development are forming the bases on which all value adding services and solutions are built. Platforms such as Ticketing (365), Commerce, NFC and m2m are a few platforms that have been integrated to offer novel services and solutions. For instance, ticketing solutions such as railway ticketing, movie ticketing or air ticketing, which are built on the Ticketing platform is integrated with commerce platform based services such as mCash to increase subscriber share of wallet to Mobitel. Similarly NFC platform-based services such as travel card are integrated with the commerce-based platform service mCash. Such solutions derived by integrating platforms will be available as generic solutions or customised solutions based on specific need.</p>
      <p>Complementing the growing trend in electronic transactions, mCash makes possible a host of services such as peer-to-peer cash transfers, bill payments, etc. via mobile phone. Following Central Bank approval, mCash was launched in late 2013 and proved popular from the outset. In 2014, the service was enhanced to enable customers to pay electricity bills, receive pension payments and pay insurance premiums via their mobile phones. In addition to personal mCash accounts, customers can use the service by visiting Mobitel branches or mCash Retailer outlets across the country.</p>
      <h4>Collaborative initiatives</h4>
      <p>In June, Mobitel and Dialog Axiata commenced a joint beta trial of the GSMA Mobile Connect service, which gives consumers convenient, secure access to a wide array of digital services using their smartphones or feature phones as authentication devices. This is the first time machine-to-machine technology of this kind has been made available to Sri&nbsp;Lankan users. The actual services on offer are provided online by firms such as Kapruka, MyDeal and WoW. This is a potentially enormous new field, and leading international SIM technology providers are collaborating with operators and the GSM Association to develop small authentication apps that can be downloaded by SMS. The Mobitel/Dialog trial has demonstrated the â€˜interoperabilityâ€™ of the technology and helps pave the way for its worldwide adoption. Etisalat and other major mobile network operators are expected to join the Mobile Connect global partnership in due course.</p>
      <p>The Mobitel-hosted Google I/O Convention was held for the second year running in June 2014. It was attended by over three thousand registered participants, making it the largest ICT conference ever held in the country. The event featured in-depth sessions on building web, mobile and enterprise applications with Google and open web technologies such as Android, Chrome, OS, Google APIs, Google Web Toolkits and App Engine. Four presentations from the parent event in San Francisco were streamed to participants in Colombo and an intensely competitive â€˜hackathonâ€™ gave developers the opportunity to show off their talents.</p>
      <h4>CSR initiatives</h4>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix16.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>In support of intensified marketing efforts in Jaffna and the North, Mobitel was the â€˜official mobile communications partnerâ€™ for Jaffna IT Week 2014, a youth-friendly initiative intended to boost investment in the region by the IT/BPM sector. The event showcased the wide range of opportunities available in ICT for young people, and the programme included mentoring and counselling sessions by leading IT professionals and industry thought leaders.</p>
      <p>In Kandy, the Company participated in an e-waste clean-up campaign in partnership with the Central Environment Authority and other groups over the May-June period. A total of 312 metric tonnes of electronic waste was collected and safely recycled or disposed off.</p>
      <p>Mobitel also teamed up with Ericsson and the Open University of Sri&nbsp;Lanka to deliver ICT training to teenage girls from farming communities in Sri&nbsp;Lanka through the Connect to Learn global education initiative, which founded by the Earth Institute, Ericsson and Millennium Promise, an education charity. In this collaborative effort, Ericsson supplies the ICT equipment, Mobitel provides the required connectivity and the Open University provides teachers, classrooms and content.</p>
      <p>Finally, in a public service move, the Company launched a special hotline and call centre solution in collaboration with the National Cancer Control Programme of the Ministry of Health. The hotline provides callers with free information and advice on cancer prevention and control in Sinhala, Tamil or English.</p>
      <h4>Looking forward</h4>
      <p>The commendable market and financial performance of the Company, and its many achievements, awards and accolades are a direct result of the untiring efforts by the Company and its most valued team of people to build a company that is driven not only by profits, but also fuelled by a passion to empower a nation and its people. Mobitel salutes its valued customers who have placed their trust in the Company and in return pledges to reward that trust with a greater future filled with opportunity.</p>
      <p>Reinvigorated by sustained growth and success and inspired by the unfolding opportunities in the Information and Communications space, Mobitel will further invest in broadband technology and in building network capabilities to meet future capacity requirements. New partnerships with partners both local and international will be forged towards realising the vision of making Sri&nbsp;Lanka a knowledge rich infocomm society.</p>
      <p>As the Sri&nbsp;Lanka telecom industry matures and prepares for consolidation, in addition to investing in organic growth, the Company will take advantage of opportunities presented in the form of acquisitions towards delighting its customers with better value, service and lifestyle enhancing value-added products and services. Developing new services and building new platforms will be foremost in future plans to remain innovative, and Mobitel will assume an active role in delivering new disruptive technologies that would transform the way we live and work.</p>
      <p>Investments in quality, service and research has been paramount to Mobitel, and will be of high relevance and importance as the Company embraces the digital future. In the current knowledge economy, investments in knowledge and know-how are as critical as investing in networks and the market for future survival and growth. Surviving the future and meeting the challenges of the future ICT challenges would mean that well-informed and visionary players would be investing in their people who are an integral part of the competitive advantage of their companies. Appreciative of the importance of knowledge, Mobitel will invest in its human resources to keep abreast with latest developments as well as building competencies required to perform in a challenging future. The Company will continue to subscribe to best industry and business practices and ensure that its people are motivated and aligned to the broader values and objectives of the Company.</p>
      <p>Grounded in the principle of being different but relevant, Mobitel is on course to making Sri&nbsp;Lanka a knowledge rich infocomm society and consequently subscribing to the national vision of making Sri&nbsp;Lanka a Knowledge Hub in Asia. In that journey, Mobitel, the National Mobile Service Operator, will deliver the full potential of global ICT technologies to Sri&nbsp;Lanka, but duly adapted to meet local conditions and realities whilst maintaining its integrity and credibility in â€˜Giving Life to Thoughtâ€™ within the ICT ecosystem of Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p>

In parallel to this, promotion of the digital directory product range (web, mobile app, e-directory and directory CD) was started during the year with a view to generating new revenue for the company while raising public awareness of these cutting-edge platforms through which the general public can access the directory with ease.</p>
      <p>Yet another significant achievement during the year was setting-up of the advertising and activation arm as part of the diversification strategy. Initially it focused on carrying out activation activities of the SLT Group and later to focus on other clients particularly SME sector. Accordingly, during the year, all the activations of the SLT Group were successfully carried out by the newly established advertising and activation arm, bringing remarkable savings to the Group.</p>
      <p>Also value additions to the existing directory products occurred in the year. As such, the Rainbow Pages web portal was improved and revamped with many new features in order to best cater to the evolving needs of the general public as well as the advertisers. The Rainbow Pages mobile apps was also improved significantly.</p>
      <p>During the year 2014, the Company earned a remarkable net profit before tax of Rs. 214 million and net profit after tax of Rs. 154 million.</p>

      <h4>Performance overview</h4>
      <p>Playing a pivotal role in driving SLTâ€™s strategic investments for 4G LTE and Carrier Grade Wi-Fi deployments across the country, Sky Network (Private) Limited continued to successfully manage several concurrent undertakings designed to increase bandwidth levels and upgrade broadband capabilities in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p>
      <h4>SLT 4G LTE implementation</h4>
      <p>Responding proactively to SLTâ€™s plan to retain at least 75% of the fixed broadband market share in the country by end 2017 through the roll-out of complementary fixed broadband platforms, SLTâ€™s 4G LTE service was launched during the year 2014 by upgrading the 4G WiMAX network of Sky Networks (Private) Limited while a large scale 4G LTE deployment spanning over three years was moved off the ground by awarding the tender for the implementation. Under this large scale deployment more than 1,500 TD LTE base stations would be commissioned across the country up to end 2017.</p>
      <h4>SLT Wi-Fi project</h4>
      <p>SLTâ€™s Carrier Grade Wi-Fi service was launched across 150 hotspots in the island during the year 2014. The project aims to enhance the overall attractiveness of the broadband product offering and capture a wider share of the market. Moreover, by facilitating seamless mobile offloading and roaming for SLT ADSL customers, these Wi-Fi hotspots are expected to provide mobility for the SLT Groupâ€™s fixed and mobile broadband subscribers, thereby helping to increase the customer acquisition and retention rate, in direct correlation to the growth in the number of hot-spots across the country. The Carrier Grade Wi-Fi roll-out would continue over the next few years, supplementing the projected fixed broadband growth planned up to 2017.</p>

      <h4>Training and development</h4>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix20.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
      <p>Responsibility for employee skills development at SLT lies with the Training and Development Division, which maintains four fully-equipped training schools where internal courses are conducted for employees in all areas related to company business. Each school has its own trainers with specialist knowledge in relevant areas, as well as other dedicated staff. More than 7,000 staff underwent training in the Companyâ€™s schools during the year under review.</p>
      <p>The training schedule is published quarterly on the Company intranet. Employees may select courses appropriate to their requirements. All courses include practical sessions, mainly related to technical areas, and IT courses for which employees may be nominated by their superior officers. SLT staff also follow external training courses and seminars, both in Sri&nbsp;Lanka and abroad. Their course and convention fees and other expenses are underwritten by the Company.</p>
      <p>Training requirements for each employee are assessed from completed performance-appraisal forms, which also allow staff to request training in specific areas. Based on this, the division prepares an annual training plan. Our policy is never to turn down a sincere request for training.</p>
      <p>In addition to internal staff training, the SLT Training Division also extends training and certification services to university students following relevant courses. SLT is accredited by the UK City &amp; Guilds Institution and by the universities of Sri&nbsp;Lanka to provide such services.</p>

      <h4>Professional support</h4>
      <p>SLT will meet the fees and other costs of employees who wish to gain professional qualifications provided they meet certain conditions. The Company has sponsored staff members to qualify with such bodies as CIM, CIMA, IPM, PIM, ICASL, SLIM, ACCA and ICTA.</p>

        <li>14th Annual Conference - CIM</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Library facilities</h4>
      <p>Learning culture at SLT is promoted by well-equipped company libraries, which all employees may make use of. Collectively, libraries at SLT headquarters and training schools contain more than 30,000 books and periodicals. A weekly newsletter, distributed to all employees, advertises newly acquired materials. Employees are encouraged to suggest books to be considered for acquisition.</p>
      <h4>Staff recognition</h4>
      <p>Employees who have contributed in exceptional ways towards the companyâ€™s performance and business success are recognised by the presentation of a Transformers Award. These awards are given in several categories, so that staff in all divisions and departments of the Company are eligible for them. In the year under review, a total of 110 SLT employees received such awards for their performance in 2013. The winners were honoured at a grand ceremony held at a prestigious Colombo last July, at which the Minister Telecommunications and Information Technology was the chief guest.</p>
      <h4>Knowledge culture at SLT</h4>
      <p>As a leading technology Company, SLT is heavily reliant on intellectual capital - to wit, the expert domain knowledge of employees who are specialists in one or other of the technical fields and academic disciplines relevant to our business.</p>
      <p>The Company optimises its use of intellectual capital in many different ways. Among them are knowledge circles (KCs), teams comprising specialists brought together temporarily to address a particular problem; brainstorming; training sessions conducted by in-house specialists; and dissemination of important information on the company intranet.</p>
      <h5>Knowledge circles and problem-solving</h5>
      <p>Over the years, SLT has developed the concept of â€˜knowledge circlesâ€™ in which relevant expertise is brought collectively to bear on the resolution of (usually technical) problems. When an issue is identified, a KC comprising several hand-picked members and headed by a Divisional General Manager is appointed to study the issue and propose recommendations to resolve it. Team members are drawn from all departments and seniority grades. When the problem has been dealt with, the KC is dissolved, but team members may also remain as part of a larger, cross-functional Knowledge Team headed by the Chief Corporate Officer, who is also Head of Knowledge Management (KM).</p>
      <p>KC recommendations and proposals are forwarded to senior management for approval, although in emergencies action may go forward pending approval. Proposals are also recorded in the KM log for future reference. The implementation of KC recommendations is monitored and evaluated to determine their success, cost-effectiveness and other factors.</p>
      <h5>Market research</h5>
      <p>SLT carries out regular market research studies to elicit information on customer behaviour and attitudes, brand health and customer satisfaction. Findings from these studies are shared with senior management and relevant users by way of presentations and access to a web portal where study reports are stored.</p>
      <h5>Internal knowledge-sharing</h5>
      <p>Better knowledge-sharing was an important corporate goal in 2014. As befits a telecoms group, we see knowledge-sharing as â€˜better connectivity between mindsâ€™. This metaphor illustrates the importance of ICT as a facilitator of knowledge-sharing. The gathering and exchange of ideas and information from the Web and elsewhere through social networking, micro-messaging and blogging is a vital part of SLTâ€™s knowledge culture.</p>
      <p>The Company holds regular interactive sessions at which knowledge pertinent to business functions and issues is shared. Ad hoc brainstorming sessions with multidisciplinary participation are consciously facilitated and encouraged. Storytelling sessions are held to share pertinent experiences. All these sessions are minuted and the records filed for future reference.</p>
      <p>More formal knowledge-sharing sessions are conducted by the Training Division: typically, these deal with technology, managerial soft skills, employee well-being and workplace safety. Engineers and other experts voluntarily conduct sessions for staff on new technologies and their implementation. Other subjects are covered by HR personnel and other relevant experts, typically at interactive workshops held during working hours to encourage participation. The success of this approach is evident from the number of voluntary participants at these workshops, which often have to be repeated to meet demand.</p>
      <p>Staff who have undergone training abroad are obliged to share the knowledge they have gained with other employees through presentations and reports, which are archived in the Company library for future reference.</p>
      <p>All SLT employees are encouraged to apply their knowledge to the preparation of the annual Business Plan. All suggestions are analysed and considered. â€˜Lessons learnedâ€™ logs are also closely studied by the planners and decision-makers who set strategic direction for the year. Such logs are maintained by all divisions of SLT; their subject-matter covers all business and operational areas.</p>
      <h5>Company intranet</h5>
      <p>An organisation-wide intranet facilitates communication and supports the sharing of corporate decisions and other memoranda, ideas, business information, emails, etc. among employees at all divisions of SLT. Its contents include:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>a common document portal containing forms, document templates, editorial guidelines, terms of reference, policy documents, manuals, handbooks, circulars and guides to Company processes and procedures</li>
        <li>a quick guide to products and services</li>
        <li>corporate brand guide</li>
        <li>project management</li>
        <li>programme management</li>
        <li>sales workouts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Emails are categorised as â€˜infoâ€™, â€˜circularâ€™ or â€˜socialâ€™ for easier reference.</p>
      <h5>Internal publications</h5>
      <p>Knowledge-sharing is also promoted by the publication and circulation of internal periodicals and newsletters featuring technological content, new industry developments and Group and Company news. Quarterly industry-information bulletins are compiled and circulated among senior managers. These publications are circulated and stored in electronic form, though hard-copy versions are often available. Managers are encouraged to submit comments and concurrences on the information provided.</p>
      <p>Industry trends and competitor activity are monitored and captured via media reports and advertisements. These, too, are circulated among all employees in the form of daily email bulletins.</p>
      <p>SLTâ€™s monthly in-house journal, Amathuma, is circulated to all employees. It carries business and company news in a trilingual format.</p>
      <h5>Knowledge-sharing with customers, suppliers and partners</h5>
      <p>Knowledge shared between SLT and important stakeholders is a key element in our growth and success.</p>
      <p>Knowledge shared with customers is primarily technology-, product- and service-oriented. Conversely, SLT seeks to learn from customer experience. Customer day-visits are carried out by senior SLT managers to obtain feedback of customers, and customer forums are conducted as part of our marketing-communications effort. In addition, there are a number of other channels by means of which we share knowledge with our customers in a two-way process.</p>
      <p>For enterprise customers, these channels include:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Account managers who share information with their customers on solutions, services and on technological developments, using brochures and information CDs</li>
        <li>Customer forums and events hosted by SLT</li>
        <li>Business publications</li>
        <li>Our corporate website</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Knowledge is shared with SME customers through:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Regionally-appointed provincial sales managers</li>
        <li>Indirectly through the National Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated bodies</li>
        <li>SME forums hosted at provincial level</li>
        <li>The business press and magazines</li>
        <li>SLTâ€™s corporate website</li>
        <li>Social media</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Residential customers are not neglected. SLT shares knowledge with them through:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Above-the-line media such as TV, press, radio, magazines and outdoor</li>
        <li>Social media, digital advertising, e-flyers, brochures/leaflets</li>
        <li>Our corporate website</li>
        <li>Door-to-door sales campaigns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Improved operational efficiency is the prime object of knowledge-sharing with suppliers. They, too, are visited by senior SLT managers. Pertinent issues are discussed and knowledge shared at these meetings. Other supplier knowledge-sharing channels include:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Personal visits by regionally-appointed provincial sales managers</li>
        <li>Direct communications such as emails and flyers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The media and general public are reached through:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Press conferences and briefings on major product launches and financial performance updates</li>
        <li>Press kits with information on corporate decisions, events and product information</li>
        <li>Our corporate website</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SLT also shares pertinent information with its advertising and communications agents through annual marketing presentations, briefs for advertising and promotional activities, etc.</p>
      <h4 id="mdafstin">Fostering innovation</h4>
      <p>Commencing in April 2013, we launched a â€˜Culture Changeâ€™ programme to foster the generation and propagation of innovative, workable ideas to improve our technological and service offerings and to build business. Suggestion boxes were placed in SLT offices, facilities and other buildings and employees were requested to submit their ideas A dedicated web portal, â€˜Quick Winsâ€™ was also set up for this purpose, with a specially-designed submission form and process. A dedicated team analyses each idea, and those considered viable are forwarded to the relevant Chief Officer for possible implementation. Meanwhile, the idea itself is recorded for future reference and use.</p>
      <p>Staff members whose ideas are selected for implementation receive Company recognition and financial rewards. The selected â€˜quick winâ€™ is circulated by email in all three languages. In the year under review, 33 â€˜quick winsâ€™ were recognised.</p>
      <h4 id="mdagrvhp">Grievance-handling procedure</h4>
      <p>A grievance is a complaint regarding a violation or a misinterpretation of the rules or procedures of the Company, or any unfair treatment. The objects of the SLT grievance-handing procedure are as follows:</p>
      <ol class="list list-123">
        <li>Establish a formal forum for the hearing and settlement of grievances.</li>
        <li>Build trust and rapport between management and employees.</li>
        <li>Improve workplace co-operation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Any staff member with a grievance may take up the matter personally or through his or her trade union representative. The matter should be reported orally or in writing to the employeesâ€™ Head of Division within a stipulated period. If a satisfactory resolution is not obtained or if there is any delay in obtaining relief, the employee may then appeal in writing to the relevant Chief Officer, who will take steps to resolve the grievance or refer the matter to the Human Resources Group. Any employee not satisfied with the relief granted by the Chief Officer may also appeal further in writing to the Human Resources Group. In the latter case, the Chief Officer (HR &amp; Legal) or his representative may take steps to resolve the grievance or may refer it to a Committee comprising himself, the Head of Division (Employee Relations) or Manager (Employee Relations) and another senior member of the management team. Beyond this, further appeal may be made to the Chief Executive Officer, whose determination is final and binding.</p>
      <h5>Performance-related grievances</h5>
      <p>Employees may also report and seek action on performance-related issues, such as inappropriate or unrealistic goals or targets, unfair evaluation by the supervisor or lack of transparency in evaluation, or violation of the Companyâ€™s performance-management guidelines.</p>
      <h5>Grievance handling committee</h5>
      <p>The Grievance Handling Committee consists of the following officers:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>The Chief HR Officer</li>
        <li>The Relevant Chief Officer or representative</li>
        <li>The DGM Performance Management</li>
        <li>The DGM - Employee relations &amp; Benefit management</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="hspmda">Health and safety policy</h4>
      <p>SLT is determined to provide a safe and healthy working environment for every employee, even as we seek to increase productivity by preventing or controlling industrial accidents, occupational diseases, etc.</p>
      <h5>Health and safety goals</h5>
      <ol class="list list-123">

        <li>Manage work-related injuries and illness within the framework of SLTâ€™s values and maximise person-hours at work.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Whistle-blowing</h4>
      <p>The Company encourages employees who have concerns about suspected misconduct or a breach of laws and regulations that may adversely affect the Company to come forward and express their concerns without fear of punishment or unfair treatment. It is also company policy to address any complaint of attempted or actual interference, reprisal, retaliation, threat, coercion or intimidation against employees who report, disclose or investigate improper or illegal activities and to protect those who come forward. Reports to management may be made anonymously if desired.</p>
      <p>The existence of a distinct whistle-blower policy does not affect or alter Company policies and procedures for handling employee grievances or complaints relating to job performance, terms and conditions of employment, disciplinary matters and sexual harassment, all of which fall under the purview of the Human Resources Department.</p>
      <h5>Whistle-blowing committee</h5>
      <p>A seven-member Whistle-blowing committee addresses every complaint. Its members include the relevant Chief Officer, who, however, has no voting power. Meetings are called when and where necessary depending on the cases referred to the committee. The Committee Secretary submits its reports at every Audit committee meeting. The report covers, in summary, all allegations received by the Company, progress on the cases referred to therein, investigation results, root causes, action taken, etc.</p>

      <h3>Helping build the knowledge society</h3>
      <p>Committed to the transformation of Sri&nbsp;Lanka into an information society, empowered by the interconnected world, Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom works in many ways to help citizens acquire and share knowledge from many sources, including one another and to apply that knowledge usefully in their lives and enterprises.</p>
      <p>At grassroots level, SLT provides the ICT network and infrastructure connecting Nenasala knowledge centres around the country. Nenasala, which means Hall of Wisdom, is a Government telecentre project developed under the e-Sri&nbsp;Lanka Initiative and implemented by ICTA. These centres enable rural Sri&nbsp;Lankans to use internet-based knowledge and services to rise out of poverty, develop culture and commerce and sustain peace.</p>
      <p>SLT also facilitates interconnectivity among the countryâ€™s universities and research organisations for the benefit of academics, students and others. Research papers and other publications are made available online and SLT provides Sri&nbsp;Lankan university students with customised, affordable broadband products and enhanced e-learning facilities. Interconnectivity among centres of higher learning and research also facilitates the formation of academic and professional networks.</p>
      <p>Public security too, is promoted by knowledge-sharing. This is another area in which SLT is closely involved. In the year under review, we entered into a contract with the Police Department to link all police stations in the country in a single voice and data network.</p>
      <p>Going beyond these contributions, which form part and parcel of our business operations, SLT has made a commitment to help Sri&nbsp;Lankans and others gain understanding of our countryâ€™s unique natural and cultural heritage with a view to sharing these riches and help preserve them for the future. This we do through the publication of corporate communication materials and other items that present nature, culture and arts of Sri&nbsp;Lanka for the edification of various stakeholder groups, including corporate clients, opinion leaders, tourists and media. The areas selected are always with immense national importance where preservation is required.</p>
      <p><img src="images/mda_pix21.jpg" class="img-responsive" ></p>
      <h3>Preserving heritage for tomorrow</h3>
      <p>One popular vehicle for this initiative is the annual SLT calendar, which is distributed across the country. Themes are selected for their currency and appropriateness; after one is decided upon, content and images are commissioned from appropriate subject experts and creative contributors. The far-reaching appeal of the SLT calendar has made it popular with academics, artists, nature lovers, students and the general public. The theme for our 2014 calendar was â€˜Medicinal Plants of Sri&nbsp;Lankaâ€™.</p>
      <h3>Spreading the wealth of knowledge</h3>
      <p>As a corporate-citizenship initiative, SLT runs a book-distribution programme for needy communities around the country in collaboration with the Asia Foundation. The programme has been in operation since 2003, with over 120,000 books distributed every year. In total, some 1.3 million books have been distributed to date.</p>
      <h3>Training and certification for ICT students</h3>
      <p>In addition to training SLT employees, the Group Training Centre also conducts external tertiary-level courses for young people looking to pursue careers in telecommunications. Following these courses, students may qualify for a City and Guilds Diploma in Telecommunications or an Edexcel/BTEC Higher National Diploma. In 2014, a total of 1,196 students attended these courses completing 180,651 training hours and one of our students, Samith Rajapaksha, became the first student from Asia to win the City &amp; Guilds â€˜International Learner of the Yearâ€™ award (see â€˜Awards &amp; Accoladesâ€™).</p>
      <p>SLT currently operates four fully equipped training centres, respectively located at Welisara, Moratuwa, Peradeniya and Galle. In addition to fully-equipped training facilities and modern laboratories, each centre also provides residential and recreational facilities to students. Small class sizes with comprehensive course materials provided, together with course fees that deliver value for money, make our courses appealing to students of all ages. Lectures are conducted by a panel of highly experienced and talented SLT engineers.</p>
      <h3>Sisu-connect and child protection</h3>
      <p>SLT is also committed to help protect the children of Sri&nbsp;Lanka from various forms of abuse through a series of interlinked activities and programmes. At the core of this effort is sisu-connect, a virtual telephone platform that enables children and their parents to stay in touch easily and affordably when the child is away at school or attending a tuition class. Sisu-connect is a joint project of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Telecommunications &amp; Information Technology and Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="thm_txt5">Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom works in many ways to help citizens acquire and share knowledge from many sources, including one another and to apply that knowledge usefully in their lives and enterprises.</p>
      <img src="images/mda_icon7.png" class="img-responsive" >
      <p>In collaboration with National Child Protection Authority SLT sponsors the lectures and workshops on child protection for children and school teachers. These activities are conducted by employees from SLT offices all over the island who volunteer for this work. By the end of the year, nearly 33,159 students in 104 schools across the island had been educated about the dangers of child abuse, how to avoid immoral influences and how to identify and report abuse cases.</p>
      <h4>Charity projects</h4>
      <p>Supporting the establishment of the national trauma service in Batticaloa as the Super Platinum Sponsor for the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital project initiated by The Foundation Supporting A National Trauma Service in Sri&nbsp;Lanka (Project BEAP).</p>
      <p>Donation of books to libraries in Cancer Hospital Maharagama - In keeping with the true spirit of the Wesak season, books were donated to set up 21 libraries at the Cancer Hospital wards. Employees volunteered books for donation and 1,500 books were donated to the hospital. Books donated covered varying subjects including spiritual books, story books and novels, childrenâ€™s books as well as educational books to suit the reading preferences of children, youth, adults and senior citizens who receive treatment at the hospital.</p>
      <h3>Other CSR activities</h3>
      <h4>ICT awareness programme for young people, Anuradhapura</h4>
      <p>In collaboration with the Regional Chamber of Commerce, Anuradhapura, SLT conducted an awareness workshop at Anuradhapura recently in an effort to enhance ICT literacy levels. The workshop was conducted for the children of the Companyâ€™s small and medium-sized enterprise customers in the area. The workshop was a success, with an attendance of nearly hundred children of SME. The programme included presentations on ICT for business, connectivity solutions and cloud computing and included live demonstrations of products for the SME sector such as internet services, new-technology devices, cloud computing solutions and surveillance camera systems.</p>
