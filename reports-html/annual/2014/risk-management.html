      <h1>Risk management</h1>
      <h2>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)</h2>
      <p>Considering the exposure to risks of competitiveness and volatility of business environments, probable customer migration to other operators, increasing substitution offerings, fast changing technology, economic uncertainties and possible cyber-attacks; SLT’s staff have been made vigilant for visualising the business critical risks through the ERM process. In 2014, the Board of Directors has taken another step to keep ERM tone on by setting up of a Risk Management Committee (RMC) at Board level chaired by a Director to drive the ERM process within SLT more efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>Now risk management culture is maturing at functional units as well as in project management at SLT. Over the past several years since introduction of ERM in 2010, ERM has become an important Business-As-Usual (BAU) process. ERM has enabled us to escalate business critical risks identified by functional groups to appropriate levels. In addition to the RMC, a Risk Management Steering Committee (RMSC) chaired by CEO too, has been set up under the guidance of the RMC and is in operation. Since the latter part of 2014, top business critical risks are escalated to the RMC. At RMC, the escalated risks are scrutinised and directions are given to risk owners to mitigate the identified risks. </p>
      <p>Table below summarises top business critical risks – both industry specific and Company specific, a brief description of each risk, their potential impact, our assessment of the level of severity of each risk and actions taken to mitigate them. </p>
