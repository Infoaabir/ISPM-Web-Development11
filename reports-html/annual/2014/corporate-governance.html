      <h1>Corporate governance</h1>
      <p><img src="images/cg_pix0.jpg" class="img-responsive" ></p>
      <br>
      <p>The Board and Management of Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom PLC firmly believe that good corporate governance is critical to the sustainability of the Company’s businesses and performance. We are committed to continuously enhance the standards of corporate governance principles and processes so as to improve performance, accountability and transparency of the Company.</p>
      <p>This report sets out the key aspects of the Company’s corporate governance framework and practices, with specific reference to the principles and guidelines set out in Section 7.10 of the Colombo Stock Exchange Listing Rules.</p>
      <p>The corporate governance philosophy practiced is in full compliance with the following steering instruments on governance:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Internal Company rules and processes and industry codes of practice</li>
        <li>Company’s Articles of Association</li>
        <li>Legislation, particularly the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007</li>
        <li>Continuing Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange </li>
        <li>Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance issued jointly by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri&nbsp;Lanka and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</li>
        <li>Telecommunication Act No. 21 of 1991 as amended by Act No. 27 of 1996.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="cgcgf">Corporate Governance Framework</h2>
      <img src="images/diagram/cg_dig1.jpg" class="img-responsive" >
      <h2 id="cgtbd">The Board of Directors</h2>
      <h3>Composition of the Board</h3>
      <p>During the year, the Board comprised the Chairman and eight non-executive Directors (including two Non-Independent Directors). The independence of the Directors has been determined in accordance with the requirements of the CSE Listing Rules. </p>
      <p>Ms. Lai Choon Foong was appointed to the Board in May 2014 in place of Mr. Sandip Das who resigned from the Board on 24 April 2013. </p>
      <p>Between them, the Directors bring experience and independent judgment at a senior level of business operations making use of their expertise in their diversified areas and international exposure. The Directors provide a strong independent element on the Board. However, the Board operates as a single team. </p>
      <h2>Ownership structure </h2>
      <img src="images/graphs/cg1.jpg" class="img-responsive" >
      <p>As of the shareholding structure of the Company, two major shareholders namely, the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka acting through the Secretary to the Treasury and the Global Telecommunication Holdings NV recommend five and four Directors respectively to the Board. The Board as empowered by the Articles of Association of the Company appoints them to the Board after deliberation of their qualifications, experience and expertise in relevant functional areas by the Nomination Committee. However, all Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to be elected by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, if appointed by the Board. A Director must also retire by rotation and may seek re-election at the AGM if he or she was last elected or re-elected at or before the AGM held in the third year before the year in question.</p>
      <h2>The role of the Board</h2>
      <p>The Board is responsible for the overall conduct of the Group’s business and has the powers, authorities and duties vested in it by and pursuant to the relevant laws of the country and the Articles of Association of the Company. The Board:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>has final responsibility for the management, direction and performance of our businesses; </li>
        <li>is required to exercise objective judgment on all corporate matters independent from executive management; </li>
        <li>is accountable to shareholders for the proper conduct of the business; and </li>
        <li>is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of and reporting on our system of corporate governance. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision and these include:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Group strategy and long-term plans in line with the technological developments;</li>
        <li>Major capital projects, acquisitions or divestments; </li>
        <li>Annual budget and operating plan; </li>
        <li>Group financial structure, including tax and treasury; </li>
        <li>Quarterly, half yearly and annual financial results and shareholder communications; </li>
        <li>System of internal control and risk management; and </li>
        <li>Senior management structure, responsibilities and succession plans. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other specific responsibilities are delegated to Board committees which operate within clearly defined terms of reference. Details of the responsibilities and operations of the sub-committees are given below:</p>
      <h2>Operation of the Board</h2>
      <p>The Board met seven times during the year. These meetings, together with any committee meetings, are generally held within a period of three days as determined by all the Directors. Its focus is on the overall strategic direction, development and control of the Company.</p>
      <p>The Chairman, along with the Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary, ensures that the Board functions effectively and has established processes designed to maximise its performance and effectiveness. Key aspects of these processes are:</p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed by the Company Secretary to all Directors usually four working days in advance of Board and committee meetings.</li>
        <li>The GCEO along with the respective Chief Officers and the Heads of Divisions present their submissions to the Board and provide the necessary clarifications requested by the Board. The Board, once satisfied with the management recommendations approve the proposals.</li>
        <li>The Board has a procedure for Directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense. In addition, all Directors have access to the advice and services of the Secretary. He advises the Board on appropriate procedures for the management of its meetings and duties, as well as the implementation of corporate governance practices and compliance with the requirement of the Companies Act, Listing Rules and the Articles of Association of the Company.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The attendance of individual Directors at Board meetings and Committee meetings during the year is set out in the table below:</p>

      <h3>Independence of Directors and segregation of duties </h3>
      <p>The Board believes that all are currently independent of management and free from any material business or other relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment. Their <a href="board-of-directors.html">profiles</a> demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring the independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct which is vital to the Group.</p>
      <h3>Indemnities to Directors</h3>
      <p>In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of the performance of their duties in their capacity as Directors to the Company. The indemnity would not provide any coverage to the extent the Director is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has maintained Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance cover throughout the year.</p>
      <h3>Policy on appointment and reappointment</h3>
      <p>In accordance with the Articles of Association, all Directors are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every three years by rotation and also following their appointment. Accordingly, the Directors appointed by the Board during the year and before signing of this Report are offering themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. </p>
      <h3 id="cgrtc">Role of the Chairman</h3>
      <p>The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are distinct and the division of responsibility of the CEO has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is non-executive and is responsible for leading the Board and for the effectiveness of the Board ensuring that it meets its obligations and responsibilities. He ensures that Board procedures are followed and all members effectively participate during meetings. The Chief Executive is responsible to the Board for the day-to-day management of the business, leadership of the executive team and execution of the Group’s strategic and operating plans. The Chairman and the Chief Executive meet regularly to discuss any issues pertaining to the Company’s performance, human resources aspects and organisation.</p>
      <h3>The Company Secretary </h3>
      <p>The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and to the committees of the Board. The Company Secretary:</p>

      <h3>Delegation to Board members</h3>
      <p>SLT has in place a number of mandatory and voluntary Board sub-committees to fulfil regulatory requirements and for better governance of its activities. These committees meet regularly to consider and discuss matters falling within respective TORs and their observations and recommendations are duly reported. </p>
      <p>The Board commenced the year with five sub-committees under the Board: audit, remuneration, nomination, technology sub-committee and Senior Tender Board. The Board has delegated some of its authority to the committees, each of which is filled with Directors who can bring their expertise and experience to the assigned committee.</p>
      <h3>Internal control and risk management </h3>
      <p>The Board ensures that internal controls are properly established and maintained through the Audit Committee. </p>
      <p>The Board was directly involved in assessing the risks associated with the business and of the Company. However, having identified the importance of managing the risk the Board during the course of the year formed the Risk Management Committee to give more attention to the Group risks. </p>
      <p>The duties of the committees are set out in formal terms of reference. They are available on request from the Company’s registered office during normal business hours. </p>
      <p>This report as at end 2014, reflects the composition and responsibilities of the sub-committees before the reconstitution.</p>

      <h3>Dialogue with institutional shareholders </h3>
      <p>Corporate information is also available on the Company’s website: www.slt.lk </p>
      <h3 id="cgcagm">Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting </h3>
      <p>The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and all shareholders are encouraged to participate. The Chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions. </p>
      <p>SLT held its 17th Annual General Meeting on 9 April 2014 with the participation of approximately 400 shareholders. </p>
      <p>The following resolutions were approved at the AGM: </p>
      <ul class="list list-disc">
        <li>Approval of annual report of the Board of Directors on the affairs of the Company and the statement of accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 with the report of the auditors’ thereon.</li>
        <li>Approval of a first and final dividend of Eighty Five Cents (0.85 Cents) per share as recommended by the Directors.</li>
        <li>Re-election of Messrs Lawrence Paratz and Chan Chee Beng, who retired by rotation in terms of Articles 91 and 92 of the Articles of Association.</li>
        <li>Reappointment of Messrs KPMG, Chartered Accountants as auditors for the ensuing year and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.</li>
        <li>Authorisation of Directors to determine and make donations to charities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Major transactions</h3>
      <p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Companies Act, has been disclosing to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to the SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2014. </p>
      <h3>Related party transactions</h3>
      <p>Though the Board of Directors has applied the related party transactions rules adopted by the SEC on related party transactions throughout its decision-making process to avoid any conflicts of interest that may occur, the Board has recognised the importance of a Related Party Transactions Committee (RPTC) under the Board of Directors to enhance corporate transparency and promote fair transactions between SLT and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, a RPTC was formed comprising three non-executive independent Directors with the objective of ensuring that the interests of shareholders are taken into account when entering into RPTs. RPTC functions under the purview of the audit committee.</p>
      <p>The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries disclosed in Note 33 to the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, the Board believes those transactions are exempted in accordance with exceptions specified in the Code of Best Practices on Related Party Transactions issued by SEC. All these are recurrent transactions and are in the ordinary course of business of the Company. </p>
      <h3>Statement of compliance</h3>
      <p>SLT is fully compliant with the requirements stipulated in Section 7.10 on ‘Corporate Governance’ of the Continuing Listing Requirements of the Colombo Stock Exchange issued in 2010 and subsequent amendments/guidelines thereto issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri&nbsp;Lanka. See the table below for the rules on ‘Corporate Governance Principles’ and the degree of compliance to the said rules. </p>
      <p>In addition, the Board of Directors to the best of their knowledge and belief satisfied that all statutory payments due to the Government, other regulatory and those payments related to employees of SLT, have been made on time.</p>
