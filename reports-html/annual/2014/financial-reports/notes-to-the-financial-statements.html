<h1>Notes to the financial statements</h1>
<p>(All amounts in Sri&nbsp;Lankan Rupees million)</p>
<h2>1 Reporting entity
</h2>
<p>Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom PLC (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in 
  Sri&nbsp;Lanka. The address of the Company’s registered office is Lotus Road, Colombo 1. The separate financial statements of the Company relates to Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom PLC. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 
31 December 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’). The Financial statements of all companies within the Group are prepared for a common financial year which ends on 31 December. The Group primarily is involved in providing broad portfolio of telecommunication services across Sri&nbsp;Lanka. In addition, the range of services provided by the Group include, interalia, internet services, data services, domestic and international leased circuits, broadband, satellite uplink, maritime transmission, IPTV service and directory publishing.  The Company is a quoted public Company which has its listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange.</p>
<h2>2 Basis of preparation</h2>
<h3>(a)  Statement of compliance</h3>
<p>The financial statements of the Group and the Company which comprises the statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows have been prepared in accordance with Sri&nbsp;Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS &amp; LKAS) as laid down by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri&nbsp;Lanka (ICASL) and the requirements of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.</p>
<h3>(b)  Approval of financial statement by Directors </h3>
<p>The consolidated and Company financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with the resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2015. </p>
<h3>(c)  Basis of measurement</h3>
<p>The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and applied consistently with no adjustments being made for inflationary factors affecting the financial statements except for the following item: </p>
<p>‘The liability for defined benefit obligation is actuarially valued and recognised at the present value of the defined benefit obligation.’</p>
<p>The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.</p>
<h3>(d)  Functional and presentation currency</h3>
<p>These financial statements are presented in Sri&nbsp;Lankan Rupees, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency. All financial information presented in Sri&nbsp;Lankan Rupees 
  has been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<h3>(e)  Use of estimates and judgments</h3>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Sri&nbsp;Lanka Accounting Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>
<p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.</p>
<p>Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and  judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes:</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>Note 13 - Property, plant &amp; equipment </li>
  <li>Note 14 - Intangible assets</li>
  <li>Note 20 - Trade and other receivables</li>
  <li>Note 23 - Deferred tax</li>
  <li>Note 24 - Deferred income</li>
  <li>Note 26 - Employee benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>(f)  Changes in accounting policies</h3>
<p>No changes in accounting policies have taken place during the year ended 31 December 2014 other than those disclosed in Note 3 (ii-a).</p>
<h2>3 Significant accounting policies</h2>
<p>The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The accounting policies of the Company have been consistently applied by the Group entities where applicable and deviations, if any, have been disclosed in Note 34.</p>
<h3>(a)  Basis of consolidation</h3>
<h4>(i)  Business combinations</h4>
<p>The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.</p>
<p>The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<p>Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<h4>(ii)  Subsidiaries</h4>
<p>Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements 
  of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.</p>
<h5>(ii-a)  Changes in accounting policies</h5>
<p>SLFRS 10 which is effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, replaces the guidance on control and consolidation in LKAS 27 - ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ and in 
  SIC 12 ‘Consideration - Special Purpose Entities’.</p>
<p>The Group has reviewed its investments in other entities to assess whether the conclusion to consolidate is different under SLFRS 10 than under LKAS 27. No differences were found for any of the investments.</p>
<h5>(ii -b)  Critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies</h5>
<p>The Directors have concluded that the Group controls all subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-c), below:</p>
<h5>(ii-c)  Interest in subsidiaries</h5>
<p>Set out below are the Group’s principal subsidiaries as at 
  31 December 2014.</p>

<h4>(iii)  Non-controlling interest (NCI)</h4>
<p>NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.</p>
<h4>(iv)  Loss of control</h4>
<p>When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) 
  and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest in the former subsidiary 
  is measured at fair value when control is lost.</p>
<h4>(v)  Transactions eliminated on consolidation</h4>
<p>Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income 
  and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.</p>
<h3>(b)  Foreign currency</h3>
<h4>(i)  Foreign currency transactions</h4>
<p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.</p>
<h3>(c)  Financial instruments</h3>
<p>The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the 
  following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit 
  or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables 
  and available-for-sale financial assets.</p>
<p>The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.</p>
<h4>(a)  Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities – Recognition and derecognition</h4>
<p>The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date.</p>
<p>The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.</p>
<p>
  The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. </p>
<p>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either 
  to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

<p><em>* Cash and cash equivalents</em></p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

<p><em>** Trade and other receivables</em></p>
<p>Trade and other receivables are stated at their estimated 
  realisable amount.</p>
<h5>(a-ii)  Non-derivative financial liabilities – Measurement</h5>
<p>Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>
<h5>(a-iii)  Fair value measurement</h5>
<p>SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell and asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactions between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
<p>A Fair value measurement requires an entity to determine the following:</p>
<ol class="list list-123">
  <li>The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement.</li>
  <li>For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and best use).</li>
  <li>The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability.</li>
  <li>The valuation technique(s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorised.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).</p>
<p>When a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, an entity measures fair value using another valuation technique that maximises the use of relevant observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs. Because fair value is a market-based measurement, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. As a result, an entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfill a liability is not relevant when measuring fair value.</p>
<p>When an asset is acquired or a liability is assumed in an exchange transaction for that asset or liability, the transaction price is the price paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price). In contrast, the fair value of the asset or liability is the price 
  that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability (an exit price).</p>
<p>When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.</p>
<h5>Determination of fair values</h5>
<p>The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other risks affecting the specific instrument.</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>Level 1 - Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;</li>
  <li>Level 2 - Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and</li>
  <li>Level 3 - Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset 
    or liability that are not based on observable market data 
    (i.e., unobservable inputs).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Amortised cost</h5>
<p>The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.</p>
<h5>(a-iv)  Reclassification</h5>
<p>Reclassifications of financial assets, other than as set out below or of financial liabilities between measurements categories are not permitted following initial recognition.</p>
<p>Held-for-trading non-derivative financial assets are transferred out of the held at fair value through profit or loss category in the following circumstances: to the available-for-sale category, where, in rare circumstances, they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term; or to the loan and receivables category, where they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term and they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
<p>Financial assets are transferred out of the available-for-sale category to the loan and receivables category where they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
<p>Held-to-maturity assets are reclassified to the available-for-sale category if the portfolio becomes tainted following the sale of 
  other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets 
  prior to their maturity.</p>
<p>Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification. For financial assets reclassified out of the 
  available-for-sale category into loans and receivables, any gain or loss on those assets recognised in shareholders’ equity prior to the date of reclassification is amortised to the profit or loss over the remaining life of the financial asset, using the effective interest method.</p>
<h5>(a-v)  Derivative financial instruments</h5>
<p>The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposure.</p>
<p>Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of 
  profit or loss and other comprehensive income as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>(b)  Impairment</h4>
<h5>(b-i)  Non-derivative financial assets</h5>
<p>Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
<p>Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes -</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>default or delinquency by a debtor;</li>
  <li>restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;</li>
  <li>indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;</li>
  <li>adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;</li>
  <li>the disappearance of an active market for a security; or</li>
  <li>observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
<table class="left2 text-top">
  <tbody>
    <tr class="line-blkthin line-blkthintop ">
      <td>Financial assets measured<br />at amortised cost</td>
      <td>The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment. Those found not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet individually identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics. In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="line-blkthin">
      <td>Available-for-sale<br />financial assets</td>
      <td>Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The amount reclassified is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
        If the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security subsequently increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss is reversed through statement of profit or loss; otherwise, it is reversed through OCI.</td>

</table>
<h5>(b-ii)  Non-financial assets</h5>
<p>At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than, investment property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.</p>
<p>For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs 
  or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies 
  of the combination.</p>
<p>The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.</p>
<p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
  or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
<p>Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.</p>
<p>An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
  if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>
<h3>(d)  Property, plant &amp; equipment</h3>
<h4>(i)  Recognition and measurement</h4>
<p>Items of property, plant &amp; equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
</p>
<p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that asset. </p>
<p>When parts of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment have 
  different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
  (major components) of property, plant &amp; equipment.</p>
<h4>(ii)  Subsequent costs</h4>
<p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment 
  is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable 
  that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will 
  flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant &amp; equipment are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<h4>(iii)  Depreciation</h4>
<p>Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line 
  basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment. In the year of acquisition, depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.</p>
<p>Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
  at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. </p>
<p> The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:</p>

</table>
<h4>(iv)  Capital work-in-progress</h4>
<p>Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.</p>
<p>Major spare parts and project-related inventory qualify as 
  property, plant &amp; equipment when the entity expects to use them during more than one period and are used in connection with specific items of property, plant &amp; equipment. </p>
<h4>(v)  Derecognition</h4>
<p>The carrying amount of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment is derecognised on disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant &amp; equipment and are recognised net within ‘other income’ in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.</p>
<p>When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.</p>
<h4>(vi)  Borrowing cost</h4>
<p>Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.</p>
<h3>(e)  Intangible assets</h3>
<h4>(i)  Goodwill</h4>
<p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. </p>
<p>Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see Note 3 (a) (i).</p>
<p>Subsequent measurement</p>
<p>Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<h4>(ii)  Other intangible assets</h4>
<p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<h4>(iii)  Licenses</h4>
<p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as license fee and is being amortised over the license period on a straight-line basis.</p>
<h4>(iv)  Subsequent expenditure</h4>
<p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>
<h4>(v)  Amortisation</h4>
<p>Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: </p>
<p>Software 3-5 years</p>
<h3>(f)  Leased assets</h3>
<p>Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted 
  for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.</p>
<p>
  For operating leases, the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position.</p>
<h3>(g)  Inventories</h3>
<p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable 
  value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average 
  cost principle. Value of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.</p>
<h3>(h)  Stated capital </h3>
<p>Ordinary share capital</p>
<p>Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.</p>
<h3>(i)  Government grants</h3>
<p>Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on a systematic basis over the useful 
  life of the asset.</p>
<h3 id="ntsempb">(j)  Employee benefits</h3>
<h4>(i)  Defined contribution plans</h4>
<p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during services is rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.</p>
<h5>Employees’ provident fund</h5>
<p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
<p>All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances. Employees of SLT Services (Private) Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), where the Company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.</p>
<h5>Employees’ Trust Fund</h5>
<p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 id="ntsdbp">(ii)  Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method as recommended by LKAS 19 - ‘Employee Benefits’. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the reporting date and have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations.</p>
<p>The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Company’s obligation in respect of a plan in other comprehensive income. </p>
<p>The present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the defined retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 26. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.</p>
<p>Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the first year of service for all employees, in conformity with LKAS 19 - ‘Employee Benefits’. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises only on completion of 5 years of continued service.</p>
<h4>(iii)  Termination benefits</h4>
<p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.</p>
<h4>(iv)  Short-term benefits</h4>
<p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.</p>
<p>A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.</p>
<h3>(k)  Provisions</h3>
<p>A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.</p>
<h3>(l)  Trade and other payables</h3>
<p>Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.</p>
<h3>(m)  Commitments and contingencies</h3>
<p>All discernible risks are accounted for in determining the amount 
  of all known liabilities. The Company’s share of any contingencies 
  and capital commitments and of its Subsidiaries for which the Company is also liable severally or otherwise are also included with appropriate disclosures.</p>
<h3>(n)  Revenue</h3>
<p>Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of trade discounts, volume rebates and after eliminating the sales within the Group.</p>
<p>Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exist, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.</p>
<p>If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.</p>
<p>The revenue is recognised as follows:</p>
<h4>(i)  Domestic and international call revenue, rental income</h4>
<p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as 
  revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation to the period of services rendered.</p>
<h4>(ii)  Revenue from other network operators and 
  international settlements</h4>
<p>The revenue received from other network operators, local and international, for the use of the Group’s telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals. </p>
<p>Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic between other telecommunications operators is recognised at the time of transit across the Group’s network and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued is recognised under income 
  and interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs in profit or loss.</p>
<h4>(iii)  Revenue from broadband</h4>
<p>Revenue from Data services and IPTV services is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.</p>
<h4>(iv)  Revenue from other telephony services</h4>
<p>The revenue from other telephony services are recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered between the Group and subscribers.</p>
<h4>(v)  Deferred income</h4>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.</li>
  <li>IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 cable capacity are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.</li>
  <li>Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. </li>
  <li>Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(vi)  CDMA revenue </h4>
<p>The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the point the connection is activated.</p>
<h4>(vii)  Equipment sales</h4>
<p>Revenue from sale of equipment is recognised, net of taxes, once the equipment is delivered.</p>
<h4>(viii)  Sales of Directories</h4>
<p>Revenue from publication sales relating to advertising revenue is recognised on publishing the advertisement on the telephone directory and a copy delivered to the subscriber on a percentage 
  of completion method.</p>
<h3>(o)  Expenditure</h3>
<p>The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and in maintaining property, plant &amp; equipment in a state of efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit for the year.</p>
<h3>(p)  Lease payments</h3>
<p>Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.</p>
<p>
  Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.</p>
<p>
  Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.</p>
<p>
  At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.</p>
<h3>(q)  Finance income and expenses</h3>
<p>The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>Interest income from repurchase agreements</li>
  <li>Interest income from fixed deposits</li>
  <li>Staff loan interest income</li>
  <li>Interest expense from borrowings</li>
  <li>Interest expense arising from Leases</li>
  <li>Foreign exchange gains or losses</li>
</ul>
<p>Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive payment is established.</p>
<h3>(r)  Income tax</h3>
<p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>
<h4>(i)  Current taxation</h4>
<p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>
<p>Provisions for taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and the amendments thereto at the rates specified in Note 11.</p>
<h4>(ii)  Deferred taxation</h4>
<p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.</p>
<p>
  A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries as the parent company has control over the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and distribution 
  of those profits. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>
<h4>(iii)  Economic Service Charge (ESC)</h4>
<p>Economic Service Charge (ESC) is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed payment can be carried forward and set off against the income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.
</p>
<h3>(s)  Earnings per share</h3>
<p>The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. </p>
<p>Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</p>
<h3>(t)  Insurance reserve</h3>
<p>The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings an amount equal to 0.1% of additions to property, plant &amp; equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements for potential losses from uninsured property, plant &amp; equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover any losses arising from damage to property, plant &amp; equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured with a 
  third-party insurer.</p>
<h3>(u)  Dividend distribution</h3>
<p>Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. </p>
<p>Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the dividend recommended and declared by the Board of Directors, is approved 
  by the shareholders.</p>
<h3>(v)  Comparatives</h3>
<p>Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in respect of the previous period. Where the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements are amended, comparative amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.</p>
<h3>(w)  Cash flow statement</h3>
<p>The cash flow statement has been prepared using the ‘Indirect Method’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with the Sri&nbsp;Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) - ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, money at call and short notice.</p>
<h3>(x)  Events after the reporting period</h3>
<p>All material events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate, adjustments or disclosures have been made in respective notes to the financial statements. </p>
<h3>(y)  Directors’ responsibility statement</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements.</p>
<h3>(z)  New accounting standards issued but not effective 
  as at the reporting date</h3>
<p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri&nbsp;Lanka has issued the following new Sri&nbsp;Lanka Accounting Standards. However, these standards have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:</p>

<h2>4. Financial risk management</h2>
<p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. </p>
<p>The Group’s risk management processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk 
  limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
  Risk management systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes 
  in market conditions and the Group activities. </p>
<p>The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management processes/guidelines and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal reviews of risk management controls and procedures. The results of which are reported to the audit committee.</p>
<p>The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>Credit risk</li>
  <li>Liquidity risk</li>
  <li>Market risk</li>
</ul>
<p>This Note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each 
  of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
  for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management 
  of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.</p>
<h3>4.1 Credit Risk</h3>
<p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer 
  or counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
  contractual obligation and arise principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.</p>
<p>Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum 
  credit exposure.</p>
<h4>4.1.1  Trade receivables</h4>
<p>The Group has a very well-established credit policy for both International Interconnect customers and Domestic customers to minimise the credit risk. A separate committee has been established 
  to evaluate and recommend the credit worthiness for the International Interconnect customer. Further, prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating credit risk.</p>
<p>Domestic service is offered to a new customer only after 
  scrutinising through a internal blacklisted data base. The Group has a well-established credit control policy and process to minimise the credit risk. Customers are categorised according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit limit will be periodically revised as per the past monthly bill value. 
  High risk voice customers are subject to auto disconnection when they reach the threshold limit. Credit control actions and recovery actions are taken for overdue customers and defaulted customers to minimise the credit risk. High revenue-generated customers including corporate customers are monitored individually.</p>
<p>As at 31 December 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade by geographic region was as follows:</p>

<h4>4.1.2  Other investments </h4>
<p>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in government debt securities, repos and in short-term deposits with selected bankers with Board approval.</p>
<h4>4.1.3  Cash and Cash equivalents</h4>
<p>The Group held cash and cash equivalents of Rs. 4,695 million 
  as at 31 December 2014 (2013 - Rs. 3,459 million). </p>
<h4>4.1.4  Employee loans</h4>
<p>The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by ensuring the loan balance are recovered from the employees’ monthly salary, or if the employee leaves such amounts are recovered from the employees’ 
  EPF balance.</p>
<h3>4.2  Liquidity risk</h3>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.</p>
<p>The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis, which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury division.</p>
<p>The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted:</p>

<h3>4.3  Market risk</h3>
<p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. </p>
<h4>4.3.1 Currency risk</h4>
<p>The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than Sri&nbsp;Lankan Rupees (LKR).</p>
<p>The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:</p>

<h4>4.3.2  Interest rate risk</h4>
<p>Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of interest rates.</p>
<p>Foreign currency borrowing at variable interest rate with a cap minimises any adverse impact due to an upward movement of 
  USD interest rate in the market. Further, the Company has obtained 
  an interest rate SWAP to minimise the impact of variable interest 
  rate borrowing. </p>
<p>Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Interest rate sensitivity of the Company was computed using the 
  floor interest rate (minimum) of 4.75% and cap interest rate (maximum) of 6.75% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below:</p>

<h2>5. Operating segments </h2> 
<p>The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions offer different products and services and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker - CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.</p>
<ul class="list list-disc">
  <li>Fixed Telephony operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.</li>
  <li>Mobile Telephony operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.</li>
  <li>Other Segment operations includes Directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2014 or 2013.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax. 
  As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.</p>

<h2>8. Refunds on Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC)</h2>
<p>In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka, based on international call minutes terminated in the country. This levy was made effective from 3 March 2003, where initially the levy was defined in such a way that operators were allowed to claim 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges. </p>
<p>First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July 2010 with a TDC rate change from US cents 3.80 to US cents 1.50. 
  Through the same revision, the disbursement process was removed from the regulation. The revised rates prevailed until such time the rate 
  was again revised to US cents 3.0 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012.</p>
<p>Total TDC refunds claimed are as follows:</p>

  <li>On 1 September 1991, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) transferred its entire telecommunications business and related assets and liabilities to SLT. A valuation of the assets and liabilities transferred to SLT was performed by the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka. The net amount of those assets and liabilities represents SLT’s Contributed Capital on incorporation and the value of property, plant &amp; equipment as determined by the Government of Sri&nbsp;Lanka. Valuers were used as the opening cost of fixed assets on 1 September 1991 in the first statutory accounts of SLT. Further, SLT was converted into a public limited company, Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom Limited (SLTL), on 25 September 1996 and on that date, all business and the related assets and liabilities of SLT were transferred to SLTL as part of the privatisation process.</li>
  <li>The cost of fully depreciated assets still in use in the company as at 31 December 2014 was Rs. 49,285 million (2013 - Rs. 90,030 million).
    The cost of fully depreciated assets still in use in the Group as at 31 December 2014 was Rs. 59,385 million (2013 - Rs. 93,476 million).</li>
  <li>No assets have been mortgaged or pledged as security for borrowings of the Company. However, Mobitel (Private) Limited, a subsidiary 
    of the Company, has pledged its assets at a value of Rs. Nil as at 31 December 2014 (2013 - Rs. 9.7 billion).</li>
  <li>The Directors believe that the Company has freehold title to land and buildings transferred on incorporation (conversion of SLT into a public limited company on 25 September 1996), although the vesting orders specifying all demarcations and extents of such land and buildings could not be traced. The Company has initiated action to transfer legal title documentations.</li>
  <li>The property, plant &amp; equipment is not insured except for buildings and equipment situated at SLT headquarters and Welikada premises. Further all the motor vehicles have been insured. An insurance reserve has been created together with a sinking fund investment to meet 
    any potential losses with regard to un insured property, plant &amp; equipment. At the reporting date, the insurance reserve amounted to 
    Rs. 560 million (2013 - Rs. 500 million) (Note 27).</li>
  <li>Impairment of assets mainly consists of the carrying value of switches, Rs. 29 million, that were impaired as a result of implementation 
    of Next Generation Network (NGN) (2013 - Rs. 149 million). Further a provision of Rs.489 million has been made in 2014 for switches 
    and IPTV Equipment.</li>
  <li>Additions include assets costing Rs. 11 million (2013 - Rs. 224 million) obtained under finance leases (where the Company is the lessee) and the additions of the Group includes assets costing Rs. 78 million obtained under finance leases (2013 - Rs. 249 million) where the Group 
    is the lessee.</li>
  <li>The Company capitalised borrowing costs amounting to Rs. 481 million during the year (2013 - Rs. Nil). Borrowing cost capitalised from a Group perspective amounted to Rs. 747 million (2013 - Rs. 122 million).</li>
  <li>The property, plant &amp; equipment includes assets acquired under finance leases, the net book value of which is made up as follows:</li>

<h4>Unrecognised deferred tax (assets) and liabilities</h4>
<p>Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit 
  will be available against which the group can utilise the benefit therefrom. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses of subsidiaries amounting to Rs. 195 million (2013 - Rs. 200 million) that can be carried forward against future taxable income.</p>

<p>In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial valuation. In 2014, 1967/70 Mortality Table issued by the Institute of Actuaries London (2012 - 1967/70 Mortality Table) was taken as the base for the valuation.</p>
<p>The provisions for defined obligations of Sri&nbsp;Lanka Telecom PLC, SLT Human Capital Solution Limited, SLT Publications (Private) Limited and 
  Mobitel (Private) Limited are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S. Goonetilake 
  and Associates respectively. The employee benefit liability of all other companies in the Group are based on gratuity formula.</p>
<p>The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded.</p>
<h3>Sensitivity analysis</h3>
<p>The Following demonstrates the sensitivity of the material subsidiaries to a reasonable possible change in the key assumptions employed with 
  all other variables held constant in the employee benefit liability measurement.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position, is the effect of the assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted below:</p>

<h2>35. Events after the reporting date</h2>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Company has recommended a first and final dividend of Rs. 0.89 per share (2013 - Rs. 0.85 per share) on voting 
  shares of the Company to be paid by way of cash dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>Further, this dividend is to be approved at the Annual General 
  Meeting to be held on 13 May 2015. This proposed final dividend has not been recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2014. Under the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, a WHT of 10% has been imposed on dividend declared. Final dividend proposed for the year amounts to Rs. 1,606,325,400/-, in compliance with Sections 56 and 57 of Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. As required by Section 56 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company satisfied the solvency test in accordance with the Section 57, prior to recommending the final dividend. A statement of solvency completed and duly signed by the Directors on 27 February 2015 has been audited by Messrs KPMG.</p>
<p>The 2015 interim budget was presented by the Government of 
  Sri&nbsp;Lanka (GoSL) on 29 January 2015 and approved by the Parliament of Sri&nbsp;Lanka on 7 February 2015. The GoSL is working towards enacting legislation pertaining to the budget proposals which would in turn bring the said proposals into force and also provide clarity with respect to applicability and execution considerations. Therefore, pending legislation and lucidity at this point of time, the consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 December 2014 excludes any and all impacts from the interim budget pertaining to the super-gain tax, levy on license mobile telephone operators and the discontinuation from charging the 25% telecommunication levy from prepaid card subscribers.</p>
<p>Except as disclosed above, no other events have arisen since the statement of financial position date which require changes to, 
  or disclosure in the financial statements.</p>
