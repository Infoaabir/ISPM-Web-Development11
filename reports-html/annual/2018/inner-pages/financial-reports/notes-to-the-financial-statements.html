<h3>(a)  Basis of consolidation</h3>
<h4>(i)  Business Combinations</h4>
<p>The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.<br />
  <br />
  The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.<br />
  <br />
  Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.<br />
</p>
<h4>(ii)  Subsidiaries</h4>
<p>Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.<br />
</p>
<h5>(ii-a) Critical Judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies</h5>
<p>The directors have concluded that the Group controls all subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-b), below:<br />

<h4>(iii)  Non-controlling interest (NCI)</h4>
<p>NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.</p>
<h4>(iv)  Loss of control</h4>
<p>When the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.</p>
<h4>(v)  Transaction eliminated on consolidation</h4>
<p>Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.</p>
<h3>(b)  Foreign currency</h3>
<h4>(i)  Foreign currency transactions</h4>
<p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.</p>
<h4>(C)  Financial instruments</h4>
<p>The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the
  following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.</p>
<p>The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.</p>
<h5>(i)  Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities – Recognition and derecognition</h5>
<p>The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date.</p>
<p>
  The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.</p>
<p>  The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.<br />
</p>
<p>Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.<br />
</p>
<h5>(i-ii)  Non-derivative financial liabilities – Measurement</h5>
<p>Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>
<h5>(i-iii)  Fair Value Measurement</h5>
<p>SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received
  to sell and asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactions between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
<p>A Fair value measurement requires an entity to determine all
  the following:</p>
<ol class="list list-123">
  <li>The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement. </li>
  <li>For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and best use). </li>
  <li>The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. </li>
  <li>The valuation technique (s) appropriate for the measurement, considering the availability of data with which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the inputs are categorised. </li>
  <li>Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market. </li>
</ol>
<p>When transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.</p>
<h6>Determination of Fair values</h6>
<p>The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other risks affecting the specific instrument.</p>
<ul class="list list-dash">
  <li><strong>Level 1</strong> – Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; </li>
  <li><strong>Level 2</strong> – Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.,as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices);and </li>
  <li><strong>Level 3</strong> – Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e., unobservable inputs). </li>
</ul>
<h6>Amortised Cost</h6>
<p>The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment.</p>
<h5>(i-iv)  Reclassification</h5>
<p>Reclassifications of financial assets, other than as set out below, or of financial liabilities between measurements categories are not permitted following initial recognition:</p>
<p>Held for trading non-derivative financial assets are transferred out of the held at fair value through profit or loss category in the following circumstances: to the available-for-sale category, where, in rare circumstances, they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term; or to the loan and receivables category, where they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term 
  and they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has 
  the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
<p>Financial assets are transferred out of the available for-sale category to the loan and receivables category where they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.</p>
<p>Held-to-maturity assets are reclassified to the available-for sale category if the portfolio becomes tainted following the sale of other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets prior to their maturity.</p>
<p>Financial assets are reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification. For financial assets reclassified out of the available-for-sale category into loans and receivables, any gain or loss on those assets recognised in shareholder’s equity prior to the date of reclassification is amortised to the profit or loss over the remaining life of the financial asset, using the effective interest method.</p>
<h3>(i-v)  Derivative financial instruments</h3>
<p>The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposure.</p>
<p>Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<h3>(i-vi)  Impairment</h3>
<h4>Non-derivative financial assets.</h4>
<p>Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.</p>
<p>Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes;</p>
<ul class="list list-dash">
<li>				default or delinquency by a debtor;</li>
<li>restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;</li>
<li>indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;</li>
<li>adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;</li>
<li>the disappearance of an active market for a security; or</li>
<li>Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets.</li>

              <td> The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment. Those found not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet individually identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics. In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. </td>

        <h4>Non-financial assets</h4>
        <p>At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.</p>
        <p>For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.</p>
        <p>The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.</p>
        <p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
        <p>Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.</p>
        <p>An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>
        <h3 id="note3d">(d)  Property, plant and equipment</h3>
        <h4>(i)  Recognition and measurement</h4>
        <p>Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>
        <p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that asset.</p>
        <p>When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.</p>
        <h4>(ii)  Subsequent costs</h4>
        <p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>(iii)  Depreciation</h4>
        <p>Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.<br />
        </p>
<p>Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:</p>

        <h4>(iv)  Capital Work-in-Progress</h4>
        <p>Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.</p>
        <p>Major spare parts and project related inventory qualify 
          as Property, plant and equipment when the entity expects

          and equipment.</p>
        <h4>(v)  Derecognition</h4>
        <p>The carrying amount of an item of property, plant &amp; equipment is derecognised on disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within “other income” in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, Plant and Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>(vi)  Borrowing cost</h4>
        <p>Borrowing cost directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.</p>
        <h3>(e)  Intangible assets</h3>
        <h4>(i)  Goodwill</h4>
        <p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.
          Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see <a href="notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note3" target="_blank">note 3 (a) (i)</a>.</p>
        <h5>Subsequent measurement</h5>
        <p>Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.</p>
        <h4>(ii)  Other intangible assets</h4>
        <p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>(iii)  Licences</h4>
        <p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on licence fees that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as licence fee and is being amortised over the Licence period on a straight line basis.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>(iv)  Subsequent expenditure</h4>
        <p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>
        <h4>(v)  Amortisation</h4>
        <p>Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:</p>

        </table>
        <h4>(f)  Leased assets</h4>
        <p>Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.</p>
        <p>For operating leases, the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s statement of Financial Position.</p>
        <h4>(g)  Inventories</h4>
        <p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle. Value of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.</p>
        <h4>(h)  Share capital</h4>
        <h5>Ordinary Share Capital</h5>
        <p>Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.</p>
        <h4>(i)  Government Grants</h4>
        <p>Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.</p>
        <h3>(j)  Employee benefits</h3>
        <h4>(i)  Defined contribution plans</h4>
        <p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during services is rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.</p>
        <h5>Employees’ Provident Fund</h5>
        <p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances. 
          All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which the respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances. Employees of Sri lanka Telecom (Services) Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), where the company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.<br />
        </p>
        <h5>Employees’ Trust Fund</h5>
        <p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>(ii)  Defined benefit plans</h3>
        <p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the reporting date and have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations. The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan in other comprehensive income. The present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the defined retirement benefit obligations are given in <a href="notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note26" target="_blank">Note 26</a>. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.</p>
        <p>Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the first year of service for all employees, in conformity with LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises only on completion of five years of continued service.</p>
        <h3>(iii)  Termination benefits</h3>
        <p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.</p>
        <h3>(iv)  Short-term benefits</h3>
        <p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an
          undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
          estimated reliably.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>(k)  Revenue</h3>
        <h4>(i) Goods</h4>
        <p>Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.</p>
        <h4>Equipment Sale</h4>
        <p>Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised. The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities (generally the sale of telecommunications equipment and ongoing service) is allocated to those components that are separable based on the estimated fair value of the components.</p>
        <p>The timing of the transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.</p>
        <h4>Sale of Directories</h4>
        <p>Revenue from publication sales relating to advertising revenue is recognised on publishing the advertisement on the telephone directory and a copy delivered to the subscriber on a percentage of completion method.</p>
        <h3>(ii)  Services</h3>
        <p>Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. Revenue from service contracts that cover periods of greater than 12 months is recognised in the profit and loss in proportion to the services delivered at the reporting date. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>Domestic and international call revenue 
          and rental income</h4>
        <h5>Fixed Line</h5>
        <p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation 
          to the period of services rendered.</p>
        <h5>Mobile Revenue</h5>
        <p>Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the provision of other mobile telecommunications services. Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Air time, either from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid customers through the sale of prepaid cards, is recorded in 
          the period in which the customer uses the service.</p>
        <h4>Revenue from other network operators and international settlements</h4>
        <p>The revenue received from other network operators, local and international, for the use of the Group’s telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.</p>
        <p>Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic between other telecommunications operators is recognised at the time of transit across the Group’s network and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued is recognised under income in the Income Statement and interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs 
          in profit or loss.</p>
        <h4>Revenue from broadband</h4>
        <p>Revenue from Data services and IPTV services is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.</p>
        <h4>Revenue from other ICT services</h4>
        <p>The revenue from other telephone services are recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered between the Group and subscribers.</p>
        <h4>Deferred income</h4>
        <p>The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.</p>
        <p>IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 cable capacity are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.</p>
        <p>Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue.</p>
        <p>Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.</p>
        <p>Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for prepaid subscribers are initially recognised as deferred revenue 
          until such time as the subscribers use the services or credit period expires.</p>
        <h4>CDMA revenue</h4>
        <p>The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the point the connection is activated.</p>
        <h3>(l)  Expenditure</h3>
        <p>The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit for the year<br />
        </p>
        <h3>(m)  Lease payments</h3>
        <p>Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.</p>
        <p>Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction 
          of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated 
          to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance 
          of the liability.</p>
        <p>Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.</p>
        <p>At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the use of the underlying asset.</p>
        <h3>(n)  Finance income and expenses</h3>
        <p>The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:</p>
        <ul class="list list-disc">
          <li> Interest income from repurchase agreements</li>
          <li>Interest income from fixed deposits</li>
          <li>Staff loan interest income</li>
          <li>Interest expense from borrowings</li>
          <li>Interest expense arising from Leases</li>
          <li>Foreign exchange gains or losses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or 
          loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive 
          payment is established.</p>
        <h3>(o)  Income tax</h3>
        <p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.</p>
        <p>Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except 
          to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>
        <h4>(i)  Current Taxation</h4>
        <p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised or profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
          equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.</p>
        <p>Provisions for taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act (IRD) No. 10 of 2006 and 
          from 1 April 2018 new IRD Act No. 24 of 2017.</p>
        <h4>(ii)  Deferred taxation</h4>
        <p>Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments in nor taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets liabilities will be realised simultaneously.</p>
        <p>A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries as the Parent Company has control over the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>
        <p>No deferred taxation is provided for Mobitel (Private) Limited due to fact that the income taxes are computed and paid at 2% on revenue.</p>
        <h4>(iii)  Economic service charge (ESC)</h4>
        <p>ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed payment can be carried forward and set off against the income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.</p>
        <h4>(iv)  Sales tax</h4>
        <p>Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sale tax, except: where sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable.</p>
        <h3>(p)  Earnings per share</h3>
        <p>The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.</p>
        <p>Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</p>
        <h3>(q)  Insurance reserve</h3>
        <p>The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings an amount equal to 0.25% of additions to property, plant and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover any losses arising from damage to property, plant and equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured with a third party insurer.</p>
        <h3>(r)  Dividend distribution</h3>
        <p>Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.</p>
        <p>Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the dividend recommended and declared by the Board of Directors, is approved by the shareholders.</p>
        <h3>(s)  Comparatives</h3>
        <p>Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in respect of the previous period. Where the presentation or classification of items in the Financial Statements are amended, comparative amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.</p>
        <h3>(t)  Cash flow statement</h3>
        <p>The cash Flow Statement has been prepared using the “indirect method” of preparing cash flows in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – “Statement of Cash Flows”. Cash and Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. The cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, money at call and short notice.</p>
        <h3>(u)  Events after the reporting period</h3>
        <p>All material events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate, adjustments or disclosures have been made in respective notes to the financial statements.</p>
        <h3>(v)  Directors’ responsibility statement</h3>
        <p>The Board of Directors of the company is responsible for these Financial Statements.</p>
        <h3>(w)  Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements</h3>
        <p>In the preparation of these Financial Statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its financial performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.</p>
        <h4>(i)  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment</h4>
        <p>The Company assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.</p>
        <p>Where the Company determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any change in an asset’s life or residual value is reflected in the Company’s Financial Statements when the change in estimate is determined.</p>
        <h4>(ii)  Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets</h4>
        <p>The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following:</p>
<ul class="list list-abc">
	<li>			obsolescence or physical damage;</li>
	<li>significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;</li>
	<li>significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;</li>
	<li>significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;</li>
   </ul>  
	
	<p>The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation 
			
          of future cash flows and the determination of the 
          recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units 
          require significant judgement.</p>
        <h4>(iii)  Revenue recognition</h4>
        <p>Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.</p>
        <h4>(iv)  Valuation of receivables</h4>
        <p>The provision for impairment losses for trade and other receivables reflects the Company’s estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of customers to make required payments. The provision is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer credit-worthiness and the Company’s historical write-off experience etc. Changes to the provision may be required if the financial condition of its customers improves or deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs.</p>
        <h3 id="note3x">(x)  New accounting standards </h3>
        <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has issued the following new Sri Lanka Accounting Standards which are applicable for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.</p>
        <h4>SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments </h4>
        <p>SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces LKAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting.</p>
        <p>No material effect to the financial statement recognition and presentation for all periods presented, due to the adoption of SLFRS 9, except for following changes in accounting policies.</p>
        <h5>(i)  Classification and measurement</h5>
        <p>Group’s financial instruments solely constitute with debt instruments. As per SLFRS 9 the classification of debt instruments are based on two criteria: The Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding and accordingly classified as financial assets designated as fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains or losses and financial assets at amortised cost.</p>
        <p>Since financial assets of the Group meet the SPPI criteria and hold to collect contractual cash flows, they are classified as financial assets at amortised cost. The assets are included in the Statements of financial position as trade and other receivables and other investments.</p>
        <p>There are no changes in classification and measurement for the Group’s financial liabilities due to the adoption of SLFRS 9.</p>
        <h5>(ii)  Impairment assessment on financial assets </h5>
        <p>For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.</p>
        <p>Investments in fixed deposits, Treasury Bills and Bonds are considered as low risk of default.</p>
        <h5>(iii) Hedge </h5>
        <p>For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is initially recognised directly in equity in the “Cash flow hedge reserve”. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the hedge instrument is recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss.</p>
        <p>When the hedge cash flow affect the Income Statement, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the corresponding income or expense line of the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or when a hedge no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/losses existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the hedge forecast transaction ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gains/loss was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.</p>
        <p>A reconciliation between the carrying amounts under LKAS 39 to the balances reported under SLFRS 9 as of 31 December  2018 is, as follows:</p>

        <h4>SLFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts</h4>
        <p>SLFRS 15 supersedes LKAS 11 Construction Contracts, LKAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with its customers. SLFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires that revenue be recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.</p>
        <p>SLFRS 15 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their customers. The Standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract. In addition, the Standard requires relevant disclosures.</p>
        <p>The Group adopted SLFRS 15 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The effect of the transition on the current period has been disclosed in <a href="notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note24" target="_blank">Note 24</a>.</p>
        <p>The Group is primarily involved in providing a broad portfolio of telecommunication services across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of services provided by the Group include, inter alia, voice and broadband services, domestic and international leased circuits, broadband, satellite uplink, maritime transmission, IPTV service and directory publishing service.</p>
        <p>Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.</p>
        <h5>Sale of equipment </h5>
        <p>Before adopting SLFRS 15, revenue from sale of telecommunications equipment is recognised when 
          persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of 
          ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. The timing of the transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.</p>
        <p>Under SLFRS 15, revenue from sale of equipment is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the equipment. After this stage, this equipment is considered as an asset of the customer and the Group does not have any control over 
          the equipment.</p>
        <p>This equipment is sold separately to the bundled services provided by the Group since the customer could enhance 
          the service by installing advanced customer premises equipment at their own expense. This sale does not involve 
          any credit terms. </p>
        <h5>Performance obligations relevant to contracts</h5>
        <p>As a telecommunication service provider, the Group’s performance obligation related to service contracts include the installation services and maintenance services provided and the uninterrupted telecommunication service which will be provided throughout the connection period.</p>
        <p>The Group expects that the above performance obligations would be satisfied throughout the connection period. </p>
        <h5>Installation services</h5>
        <p>The Group provides installation services that are bundled together with the sale of equipment to a customer.</p>
        <p>Before adopting SLFRS 15, the revenue generated from the installation services were identified as they incurred.</p>
        <p>Under SLFRS 15, when the performance obligation relevant to installation service is performed and when a customer premises equipment is provided to the customer, this equipment is considered as an asset of the Group as long as the contract with the customer is valid. Accordingly, the Group allocates a bundled price for the equipment and installation services.</p>
        <h5>Rental and usage charge </h5>
        <p>The Group charge a fixed rental charge from the customer on monthly basis for the use of Group subsidised customer premises equipment in order to provide the 
          telecommunication service. </p>
        <p>The Group charge a variable usage charge from the customer on monthly basis depending on the usage of the service by the customer in the respective month.</p>
        <p>The Group expects that these revenues are recognised as 
          and when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for 
          a given month.</p>
        <h5>Cost to obtain a contract </h5>
        <p>The Group pays sales commission to its employees for each new connection contract that they obtain. </p>
        <p>Before adopting SLFRS 15, the sales commission relevant for new connection were charged as expense as they incurred.</p>
        <p>Under SLFRS 15, the Group identifies the sales commission paid to employees for each new contract as contract asset 
          that would be amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related goods or services to the customer.</p>
        <h5>Judgements</h5>
        <p>The Group applied the following judgement that significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.</p>
        <h6>Determining the timing of satisfaction of 
          installation services </h6>
        <p>The Group concluded that revenue for installation services is to be recognised over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. The fact that another entity would not need to re-perform the installation that the Group has provided to date demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance as it performs.</p>
        <p>The Group identifies the revenue for installation services as contract liability and recognise the revenue on a systematic basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related goods or services to the customer with the notion that the satisfaction for the installation services will be consumed by the customer over the contract period.</p>
        <h5>(1) Contract Assets</h5>
        <p>As per SLFRS 15, the costs directly attributable to customer contracts are recognized as contract assets and amortized on a systematic basis in line with the achievement of the performance obligations. Previously, these costs were directly charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss. However, if the amortization period is one year or less, the Group and the Company identify the additional cost of acquiring a contract 
          as an expenditure when incurred.</p>
        <p>The opening balance as at 1st January 2018 indicates 
          the contract asset representing the existing customer contracts which is charged to statement of Profit or Loss before 1 January 2018. The contract asset movements are provided below.</p>

        <h5>New standards issued but not effective as at 
          reporting date</h5>
        <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has issued the following new Accounting Standards which will become applicable for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group has not assessed the potential impact of its Financial Statements resulting from their application.</p>
        <h4>SLFRS 16 – Leases</h4>
        <p>SLFRS 16 introduce a single, on-balance lease sheet accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard - i.e. lessors continue to classify lease as finance or operating leases.</p>
        <p>SLFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including LKAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Leases, SIC-15 Operating Lease Incentive and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a lease.</p>
        <p>The standard is effective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2019.</p>
        <h5>Possible impact on the financial statements</h5>

The group has a well-established credit control policy and process to minimise the credit risk. Customers are categorised according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit.

        <h3>4.2  Liquidity Risk</h3>
        <p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.</p>
        <p>The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements. The Group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.

        <h3>4.3  Market risk</h3>
        <p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.</p>
        <h4>4.3.1 Currency risk</h4>
        <p>The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR).</p>
        
        <p>The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.</p>
        <p>The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:</p>

        <h4>4.3.2  Interest rate risk</h4>
        <p>Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>
        <p>To minimise the adverse impact of variable interest rate borrowings due to an upward movement of USD interest rates in the market, the Company has obtained an interest rate SWAP and arrangements are being made to obtain an interests rate CAP.</p>
        <p>Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.</p>
        <p>Interest rate sensitivity of the Company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below:</p>

        <h2 id="note5"><strong>5.  Operating segments</strong></h2>
        <p>The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker-CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.</p>
        <ul class="list list-disc">
          <li>Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.</li>
          <li>Mobile ICT operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.</li>
          <li>Other Segment operations includes Directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable 
            Segments in 2018 or 2017.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax. As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.</p>

        <h2 id="note8">8.  Refunds on Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC)</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri Lanka, based on international call minutes terminated in the country. This levy was made effective from 3 March 2003 where initially the levy was defined in such a way that Operators were allowed to claim 
          the 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges.</p>
        <p>The TDC Refund received in 2014 corresponds to the period from April 2009 to July 2010 which was the last claim obtained under the respective regulation. As the said regulation was received with effect from July 2010 while eliminating the reimbursement process, the final claim requested from TRC applicable for the above period was received on year 2014.</p>
        <p>First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July, 2010 with an International Telecommunication Operators Levy (ITOL) TDC rate change from USD cents 3.80 to USD cents 1.50. Through the same revision, the disbursement process of TDC was removed from the regulation. As stated above the revised ITOL rate prevailed until such time the rate was revised to USD cents 3.00 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012 and ITOL rate was further revised again to USD cents 6.00 per minute with effect from January 2016 in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2016.</p>
        <p>Mobitel Private Limited Recognises Telecommunications Development Charge (TDC) in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 10 years, as disclosed in <a href="notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note34" target="_blank">Note 34</a>.</p>

  <li>On 1 September 1991, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) transferred its entire telecommunications business and related assets and liabilities to SLT. A valuation of the assets and liabilities transferred to SLT was performed by the Government of Sri Lanka. The net amount of those assets and liabilities represents SLT’s Contributed Capital on incorporation and the value of property, plant and equipment as determined by the Government of Sri Lanka. Valuers were used to determine the opening cost of fixed assets on 1 September 1991 in the first statutory accounts of SLT. Further, SLT was converted into a public limited company, Sri Lanka Telecom Limited (SLTL), on 25 September 1996 and on that date, all business and the related assets and liabilities of SLT were transferred to SLTL as part of the privatisation process. </li>
  <li>The cost of fully-depreciated assets still in use in the Company as at 31 December 2018 was LKR 74,396 Mn. (2017 – LKR 69,661 Mn.). The cost of fully-depreciated assets still in use in the Group as at 31 December 2018 was LKR 88,189 Mn. (2017 – LKR 78,715 Mn.).&#9;</li>
  <li>No assets have been mortgaged or pledged as security for borrowings of the Group. </li>
  <li>The Directors believe, partaining to lands and buildings which were vested from the corporation to the Company, that the Company has freehold title to land and buildings transferred at incorporation of the Company (to take over the assets and liabilities of the corporation at the Conversion of SLT into a public limited company on 25 September 1996), by operation of law, although no specific title documents are available for each of such lands. The Company has initiated a process to obtain a title document from the Government authorities, in order to confirm the list of lands so vested with the Company. </li>
  <li>The number of buildings as at 31 December 2018, 
    is 1,180 (2017 – 1,175) </li>
  <li>All the motor vehicles have been insured. An insurance reserve has been created together with a sinking fund investment to meet any potential losses with regard to uninsured property, plant and equipment. At the reporting date , the insurance reserve amounted to LKR 791 Mn. (2017 – LKR 691 Mn.) (<a href="notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note27" target="_blank">Note 27</a>). </li>
  <li>Impairment of assets mainly consists of the 
    carrying value of Next Generation Network (NGN) 
    LKR Nil (2017 LKR – 28 Mn.), PSTN CPE LKR Nil (2017 – LKR 18 Mn.), Cable Net Work Beyond DP 
    LKR 15 Mn. (2017 – LKR 44 Mn.) and National 
    Transmission Equipment Nil (2017 – LKR 10 Mn.) 
    Cable Net Work Upto DP LKR 7 Mn. (2017 – LKR Nil) 
    were impaired due to the flood. Impairment provision 
    for pay phones LKR 5 Mn. (2017 – NIL.) and IPTV 
    CPE LKR 62 Mn. (2017 – NIL). </li>
  <li>The Company capitalised borrowing costs amounting to LKR 4,035 Mn. during the year (2017 – LKR 2,650 Mn). Borrowing cost capitalised from a Group perspective amounted to LKR 4,035 Mn. (2017 – LKR 2,650 Mn.) </li>

<h3>Adjustment due to different accounting policies of the parent and the Group entity</h3>

<p>The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following method and assumption was used to estimate the fair values:</p>
<p>Cash and bank balances, Short term deposits, Trade receivables, Trade payables (current) and bank overdraft approximate their carrying amounts lastly due to the short term maturities of these investments. </p>
<p>Fair Value of Trade and Other Payables and Borrowings have been arrived by discounting gross values by the year end 
  AWFDR rate.</p>
<h2 id="note36">36.  Events after the reporting date</h2>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Company has 
  recommended a first and final dividend of LKR 1.06 per 
  share (2017 – LKR 0.89 per share) on voting shares of the Company to be paid by way of cash dividend for the 
  financial year ended 31 December 2018.</p>
<p>Further, this dividend is to be approved at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 28 March 2019. This proposed final dividend has not been recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2018. Under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, a WHT of 14% has been imposed on dividend declared. Final dividend proposed for the year amounts to LKR 1,913,151,600, in compliance with Section 56 and 57 of Companies Act No.07 of 2007. As required by Section 56 of the Companies Act No.07 of 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company satisfied the solvency test in accordance with the Section 57, prior to recommending the final dividend. A statement of solvency completed and duly signed by the Directors on 21 February 2019 has been audited by Messrs Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
<p>Except as disclosed above, no other events have arisen 
  since the Statement of Financial Position date which require changes to, or disclosure in the Financial Statements.</p>
