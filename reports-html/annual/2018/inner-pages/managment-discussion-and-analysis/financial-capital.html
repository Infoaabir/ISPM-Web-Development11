		<p class="lifter">Financial capital refers to the monetary assets SLT utilises, such as our shareholders’ funds and borrowings, to offer our products and services. It also pertains to the monetary value of the assets we possess, such as our property and infrastructure. By combining our financial capital with the other capital, we derive value for the short, medium, and long-term for the Company and our stakeholders.</p>
			<p class="lifter">This section is an overview of our financial performance for the year under review, at both Group and Company level. The information presented below is duly supplemented with the Financial Statements and Notes.</p>
		
		
		
			<h2>Profitability</h2>
			<h3>Revenue</h3>
			<p>The impressive YoY revenue growth of 7.5% of the Group to record a figure of LKR 81.4 Bn. in 2018 compared to LKR 75.7 Bn. in 2017 which was largely driven by the Enterprise and Carrier related businesses, FTTH, IPTV and data related services together with mobile operations. SLT company’s growth was 6.4% YoY with revenue in 2018 being LKR 47.4 Bn. During the year under review the overall business focus of SLT was realigned to a digital service provider from a communication service provider, in order to be abreast of the global trends.</p>
				
			<p>Our mobile arm, Mobitel, recorded a   growth of 6.5%, to record a revenue of LKR 38.8 Bn. in 2018 from LKR 36.5 Bn. in 2017.</p>
			
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				
<h3>Operating expenses</h3>
			<p>The operating cost excluding depreciation of the Group of LKR 54.5 Bn. in 2017 increased by 2.5% to LKR 55.9 Bn. in 2018. Rigorous controls and continuous monitoring of the operating expenses have largely contributed to manage costs efficiently. The operating costs of SLT excluding depreciation increased from LKR 33.2 Bn. in 2017 to LKR 33.9 Bn. in 2018 which was an increase of 2.3%. </p>
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>

				
			<h2>Profits </h2>
			<p>The growth in revenue coupled with proper cost management had given rise to healthy YoY growth in Group’s profit before tax (PBT) of 29.7%, despite the depreciation of LKR against the US Dollar. The profit after tax (PAT) of the Group grew by 25.6% YoY. The Group PBT grew from LKR 5.5 Bn. in 2017 to LKR 7.2 Bn. in 2018, while the PAT grew from LKR 3.9 Bn. to LKR 4.9 Bn. during the same period.</p>
				
			<p>The operational efficiency of the company was accomplished primarily through efficient cost management and revenue growth in the year under review, resulting in YoY PBT growth of 47.6%, while PAT grew by 33.5% YoY. The company PBT grew from LKR 2.1 Bn. in 2017 to LKR 3.1 Bn. in 2018, while the PAT grew from LKR 1.4 Bn. to LKR 1.9 Bn. during the same period. </p>
				
				<p>Mobitel recorded a PAT of LKR 3.6 Bn. in 2018, compared to LKR 3.3 Bn. recorded in the preceding year. </p>
<p>These growths were experienced notwithstanding challenges in the business environment such as currency depreciation of 19% on average over 2018 and rising interest rates in that year.</p>

			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				
			<h2>EBITDA</h2>
			<p>The improvement in Group EBITDA was recorded as 20.5% with a movement from LKR 21.2 Bn. in 2017 to LKR 25.6 Bn. in 2018. The company EBITDA increased by 18.3% to LKR 13.5 Bn. in 2018 from LKR 11.4 Bn. in 2017. The decent growth in revenue and the cost saving initiatives adopted across the Group during the financial year, have benefited the Group as a whole to improve EBITDA.</p>
			<p>Following the same trend EBITDA Margin in 2018 was reported as 31.38% and 28.4% at Group and company levels respectively. In 2017 the same numbers were recorded as 28.0% and 25.5% at Group and company levels respectively. </p>
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				
			<h2>Return on equity (ROE)</h2>
			<p>The Group ROE increased to 6.7% in 2018 from 5.5% in 2017 while SLT as a Company, achieved an increase to 3.3% in 2018 from 2.4% in 2017. The progress in 2018 can be attributed to improved profitability in that year. This ratio measures the profit attributable to the shareholders as a percentage of their equity in the company.</p>
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				
				
			<h2>Gearing</h2>
			<p>In 2018 the Gearing Ratio for the Group was 0.43 compared to 0.37 in 2017 while the Company recorded a ratio of 0.44 in 2018 in comparison to 0.4 in 2017. The gearing ratio measures the proportion of a company’s borrowed funds to the sum of borrowings and equity. Substantial investments in capital expenditure in the financial year of 2018 had caused this escalation in gearing.</p>
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				
			<p>Since majority of the borrowings are used to fund capital expenditure, the related interest costs have been capitalised. However, Interest Cover ratio of the Group and company during 2018 were reported at 1.77 times and 0.78 times respectively.</p>
				
			<h2>Assets</h2>
			<h3>Non-current assets </h3>
			<p>The increase in total non-current assets of the Group as at 31 December 2018 was 5.4% with the same increasing from LKR 128.2 Bn. as at 31 December 2017 to LKR 135.1 Bn. as at 31 December 2018. For SLT as a company, the total non-current assets were recorded at LKR 114.6 Bn., from LKR 109.9 Bn. recorded in 2017; which represents an increase of 4.3%. </p>
				
			<p>Moreover, property, plant and equipment of the Group increased to LKR 123.9 Bn. in 2018, from LKR 117.0 Bn. in 2017, with heavy investments in ducts, cables and other outside plants which includes network rollout expenses. The company accounted for LKR 96 Bn. in 2018, compared to LKR 91.5 Bn. recorded in 2017. </p>
				
			<p>The graphs shown below depict the trends in the ratios of Asset Turnover and the Net Assets Per Share, where the value of Total Assets is considered in arriving at the ratio.</p>
				
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr10.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
				

				
			<h2>Segmental performance</h2>
			<p>The Group’s mainstream operations can be classified under fixed ICT operations and mobile ICT operations (overseen by Mobitel), with the contributing revenue percentages as 52% and 43% respectively. The balance 5% is generated from other segments. </p>
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr11.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>

				
			<p>Heavy investments over the past few years in fixed ICT operations have resulted in the asset base amounting to 70% in that segment, while the assets in mobile ICT operations segment represented only 28%. The investments in fixed ICT operations are by nature, more capital intensive than the mobile ICT operations.</p>
				
				
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr12.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
			<p><img src="../../images/mda_gr13.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></p>
