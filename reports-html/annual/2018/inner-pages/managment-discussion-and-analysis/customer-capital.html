		<h3>Comprehensive enterprise solutions</h3>
		<p>SLT collaborates with Enterprise customers to accelerate their digital transformation journey by empowering them with a range of solutions catered to their requirements. From IP-based MPLS networks and total VPN networks, to VMware and other VM infrastructure, last-mile and FTTH fibre infrastructure, SLT serves as an enabler for large and small businesses to benefit from the digital revolution.</p>
		<h2>Government partnerships and MoUs</h2>
		<h3>Port City Project</h3>
		<p>SLT signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd (CPCC) to recognise SLT as the exclusive telecommunications infrastructure service provider for a period of 15 years. SLT will develop a strategy and implementation programme for the telecommunication infrastructure of Port City, including a Smart City Solution, in coordination with the CPCC planning team.</p>
		<h3>Urban Development Authority</h3>
		<p>SLT signed an MoU with the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to undertake the development of ICT infrastructure facilities for seven new condominium projects to be built in urban areas. SLT will serve as the exclusive telecommunications infrastructure service provider and provide services via copper and fibre lines.</p>
		<h3>Western Province Council</h3>
		<p>SLT provided a total communications solution for a multi storied office complex for the Western Province Council. The solution included a networking and voice solution from the SLT Centrex platform.</p>
		<h3>Polonnaruwa Technological Museum</h3>
		<p>SLT and Mobitel jointly developed a total ICT solution for the newly built Technological Museum in Polonnaruwa. The solution is an extra low voltage (ELV) solution that covers the total LAN cabling and networking of the building with CCTV, AV, and conference systems, and a Smart solution to showcase the museum’s exhibitions. Mobitel also established an Innovation Centre to provide local and foreign visitors with an experience that takes them through our country’s important historical milestones.</p>
		<h2>Market presence</h2>
		<p>SLT has Teleshops and regional telecommunication offices across the island in central locations within convenient reach of customers, where they can avail of our services and products. In 2018, SLT opened new Teleshops in Pottuvil, Mawanella, Akurana, and Gampola, and will continue to expand our presence in small and developing townships, thus expanding our reach and increasing customer convenience. Additionally, we have an extensive dealer and reseller network across the island that enables customers to easily purchase recharge cards and register for broadband and LTE services. Customers can pay their bills at most major banking institutions, supermarkets, and select retail outlets.</p>
		
			  
		<p><img src="../../images/Market_presence.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p>
	<h2>Customer base</h2>
<p>In 2018, SLT provided over 1,717,200
fixed line connections, 966,925
broadband connections, and 415,000
PEO TV connections. Mobitel saw
its subscriber base grow by
			  approximately 800,000.	</p>	  
			  
		<h2>Customer Experience management</h2>
		<h3>Customer Service Week 2018</h3>
		<p>With SLT’s renewed focus on enhancing the customer experience, the Customer Experience Division spearheaded the company-wide celebration of Customer Service Week for the first time in 2018 by showing appreciation and rewarding loyal customers for choosing SLT as their telecommunications provider for their business and/or day-to-day life. Customer service champions in the Company were recognised and rewarded for their contributions to SLT’s efforts on customer loyalty and retention, and awareness was raised company wide about how critical superior customer service is to these efforts. Further highlighting the importance of customer service, employees were encouraged to directly engage with a customer interface to identify the pain points a customer would experience and take prompt action to rectify them.</p>
		<p><img src="../../images/Customer_Satisfaction.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p>
			  
			  
			  <h3>Customer Voice Survey</h3>
		<p>SLT conducts a customer voice survey daily to measure customer satisfaction on our customer service and after sales service including service assurance. For new service offerings, SLT measures the time taken to provide the service, the quality of service provided, and how customer expectations were addressed with the service offered; SLT recorded over 87% customer satisfaction in 2018. Voice surveys conducted for after sales service primarily measure customer satisfaction on the time taken to attend to issues; SLT measured 86% customer satisfaction.</p>
		<h3>Customer Satisfaction Index 2018</h3>
		<p>SLT continued to conduct its Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) study in 2018 to identify and measure the key expectations of customers, evaluate satisfaction levels across all touch points, and identify other issues that affect customers. A reputed market research agency conducted the study amongst a sample size of 2,500 that represented all customer segments (consumer, enterprise, SME, and Government), business verticals, and geographical areas. The study entailed a 45-minute one-on-one interview followed by an extensive questionnaire, and the results were shared among all stakeholders of the Company. Internal awareness sessions were then conducted to raise awareness of the pain points that affect customers in order to come up with effective solutions to tackle them.</p>
		<p>In 2018, the CSI index grew to 83%, a significant growth compared to 2017. This is an achievement on par with global standards for global fixed telecommunications businesses. Pain points that had been identified in 2017 had been addressed by the respective stakeholders, contributing to the increase in customer satisfaction for the period under review.</p>
		<p><img src="../../images/Customer_Satisfaction_ch.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p>

		<h3>Contact centre performance</h3>
		<p><img src="../../images/contact_cen_perf.jpg" width="827" height="300" class="img-responsive"/></p>
		<p>The SLT Contact Centre operates in two perspectives: serve SLT customers via the 1212 hotline to address customer queries on SLT products and services; secondly, to facilitate Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) for contact centre services to other business clients. The SLT 1212 Contact Centre operates in 13 stations around the country. A new Contact Centre was established in Bandarawela in January 2018, improving the geographical redundancy of the 1212 customer support service.</p>
		<p>Automated IVR services enabled for fault reporting, bill inquiries, and additional data requirements contributed to efficiency improvements for the 1212 Contact Centre, allowing agents to handle other customer queries that could not be addressed via automated IVR. In this context, out of 8.3 million calls received to agents, the average call answer rate by agents exceeded 80% as a result of increased calls due to inclement weather that lead to service disruptions.</p>
		<p>Each day in 2018 saw over 270 agents serve customers with complete commitment and dedication. Continuous quality monitoring carried out in-house helped to ensure that a high quality of service was maintained for SLT customers; a new performance metric for “First Call Resolution” (FCR) was introduced in 2018 and agents received training on how to achieve FCR during a call. The outcome was a quality level of 86.99% being achieved in 2018. Automated customer satisfaction surveys recorded over 95% of feedback as being “satisfied”.</p>
		<p>SLT is also the only Telco that maintains free-of-charge doorstep maintenance service. A feature greatly valued by customers across the Island.</p>
		<h2>SLT Digital Forums</h2>
		<p>SLT hosts a range of digital forums that are intended as a knowledge-sharing and networking platform that positions the Company within the digital services space. SLT Digital Forums bring together domain experts and representatives from private sector organisations, public institutions, and academia to discuss their ideas and experiences of the evolving digital services ecosystem.</p>
