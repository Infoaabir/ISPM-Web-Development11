			<p>Dynamic, driven, purposeful Mr Kiththi Perera’s decades of experience within Sri Lanka Telecom have seen him galvanising the Organisation at the helm of significant strategic and leadership roles across departments, as well as serving on the Board of Directors of SLT Services since 2016, and as CEO of SLT since June 2018.</p>
			<p>A Chartered Engineer of the Engineering Council (UK) and Institution of Engineering and Technology (UK), and Masters Graduate from the University of Moratuwa in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Mr Perera has brought his passion for the field and a deeper technical understanding to his twenty-four years of experience at Sri Lanka Telecom.</p>
			<p>The diversity of his expertise has been instrumental in invigorating SLT to grow as an enterprise and government business over the last seven years, whilst supporting numerous key national projects such as CHOGM 2013, Sri Lanka’s first purpose-built Tier III Data Centre at Pitipana, AKAZA Cloud, and the Colombo Lotus Tower.</p>
			<p>Mr Perera was also appointed Project Manager of the Bharat Lanka Submarine Cable System Project in 2005, as was deeply involved in the high-level design of the repeater less submarine cable system (with RA amplifiers and DWDM technology) – which was the first in South Asia.</p>
			<p>As a vital member of SLT’s initial management team, Mr Perera was not only involved in planning, designing, and developing data access networks based on GSHDSL, Metro Ethernet and Digital Radio Access technologies, but was also responsible for introducing Metro Ethernet Technology to Sri Lanka in 2005. This was a key turning point in 
			  the country’s technology field and was also Sri Lanka’s leading IT project at the time. </p>
			<p>In the course of his tenure at SLT since 1994, Mr Perera has represented the Organisation in countless national and international forums, and was also the winner of the SLT Transformer Gold Award in the Senior Management Category in 2014.</p>
			<p>Commencing his role as the telecom giant’s CEO during the cusp of an extremely exciting time in the country’s infrastructural and economic history, Mr Perera’s passion and decades of experience in management will no doubt be instrumental in SLT’s growth and synergy in the years to come.</p>
