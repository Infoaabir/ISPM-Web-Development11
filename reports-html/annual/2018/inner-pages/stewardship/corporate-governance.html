			<p class="lifter">Corporate governance at SLT is designed to create a sound and effective corporate culture that fosters trust and creates customer and shareholder value. It is based on our employees being familiar with best practices and working together to achieve common goals.</p>
			<p>Good corporate governance, risk management and internal control are key elements of a successful business and a prerequisite to maintain the trust of customers, owners, employees, authorities and other stakeholders. SLT defines corporate governance as			  the relationship between shareholders, board of directors, executive management, other employees, other Group companies and other stakeholders. In a broader sense, it also encompasses:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>How the vision, purpose and strategy are designed and communicated</li>
				<li>How well the values are complied with</li>
				<li>How goals are set and followed-up</li>
				<li>How risks are managed</li>
				<li>How future leaders are encouraged and developed</li>
				<li>How a corporate culture that promotes the interests of customers and builds shareholder value is created</li>
				<li>How transparency is promoted; and</li>
				<li>How we manage operations in a sustainable way</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Corporate governance philosophy practiced at SLT is in full compliance with the following frameworks of legislation, codes and voluntary practices. </p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Internal Company rules and processes and industry codes of practice</li>
				<li>Articles of Association (“AoA”) of the Company</li>
				<li>Legislation, particularly the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No. 27 of 1996</li>
				<li>Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange </li>
				<li>Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance issued jointly by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC).</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>SLT’s Corporate Governance Framework<br>
			  <br>
			</h2>
			<p><img src="../../images/CGFramework.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br>
			</p>
			<h2>The Board of Directors</h2>
			<h3>Composition of the Board</h3>
			<p>During the year under review the Board comprised 07 Non-Executive Directors with 05 of them being Independent. The independence of the Directors has been determined in accordance with requirements set out by the CSE Listing Rules.</p>
			<p>Their <a target="_blank" href="board-of-directors.html">biographies</a> demonstrate a wealth of experience and sufficient calibre to provide independent judgment on issues of strategy, performance, resources, and standards of conduct which is vital to the Group.</p>
			<h3>Ownership and Directors</h3>
			<p>As per the shareholding structure of the Company, two major shareholders, namely the Government of Sri Lanka acting through the Secretary to the Treasury, and Global Telecommunication Holdings N.V. recommends five and four directors to the Board respectively. The Board as empowered by the AoA of the Company appoints them to the Board, filling casual vacancies after deliberation of their qualifications, experience, and expertise in relevant functional areas by the R &amp; NC. However, all Directors appointed by the Board are required by the Company&apos;s AoA to be elected by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. In addition, in terms of the AoA of the Company, one third of the Directors, who are longest in service retire by rotation and may seek re-election at the AGM.</p>
			<h3>The role of the Board</h3>
			<h4>Providing Strategic Leadership</h4>
			<p>The Board is the highest decision-making body after the AGM. The Board is aware of internal and external issues, short-term pressure, and longer-term trends and development. The Board, while addressing certain current issues in strategic planning and contemporary issues and challenges in order to remain competitive, provides strategic directions reading the road ahead and visioning. They plan for the future while being flexible when changes are required.</p>
			<p>The Board strives to provide strategic leadership within the business. The Board is accountable to shareholders for ensuring that SLT is appropriately managed and achieves the strategic objectives it sets. The Board carries out its responsibilities through a programme of at least eight scheduled meetings a year, which includes the approval of overall budgetary planning and business strategy.</p>
			<p>The Board reviews internal controls and risk management policies and approves SLT’s governance structure and code of conduct. It also appraises and approves major financing, investment and licensing decisions, and evaluates 
		    and monitors the performance of SLT as a whole. This includes:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Engaging with, supporting, and challenging the CEO and other Senior Executives on SLT’s financial and operating performance and external issues relevant to the Group&apos;s prospects</li>
				<li>Evaluating progress towards our financial and business objectives and annual plans</li>
				<li>Scrutinising the performance of management in meeting these objectives and plans</li>
				<li>Monitoring – through reports received directly or from various committees – the key significant risks facing SLT</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Chairman, along with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO) and the Company Secretary, ensures that the Board functions effectively and has established Board processes designed to maximise its performance and effectiveness.</p>
			<p>Key aspects of these processes are:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>All Directors receive accurate, relevant, timely, clear, and balanced information that reflects their duties and responsibilities. Support provided by the Company Secretary include the flow of information between Committees, the Board and Directors, and other key players involved prior to the meeting, as well as implementation of corporate governance and compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act, CSE Listing Rules and AoA of the Company.</li>
				<li>The CEO along with the respective Chief Officers and the Heads of Divisions presents their submissions to the Board and provides the necessary clarifications requested by the Board.</li>
				<li>In addition, all Board Papers are made available in electronic format, in line with the Group’s sustainability initiatives.</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="attendance">The attendance of individual Directors at Board meetings and Committee meetings during the year is set out in the table below.</p>

			<h3>Indemnities to Directors</h3>
			<p>In accordance with the AoA of the Company, Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect to liabilities incurred as a result of the performance of their duties in their capacity as Directors to the Company. The indemnity would not provide any coverage to the extent the Director is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has maintained Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance cover throughout the year. </p>
			<h3>Role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer </h3>
			<p>Distinction between strategic and operational matters is clearly established in terms of division of responsibility of the Chairman and the Chief Executive. The Chairman of SLT is a non-executive appointment and focusses on strategic issues and monitoring the business and executive team. He ensures Board procedures are followed and all Board members effectively participate during meetings.</p>
			<p>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) together with the Chief Operating Officer (COO) is responsible for day-to-day management of the business and leadership of the executive team, and execution of the Group’s strategic and operating plans. The Chairman meets the CEO and the COO regularly to discuss any issues pertaining to the Company’s performance, operational matters, and human resources aspects.</p>
			<h3>The Company Secretary </h3>
			<p>The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board and is available to individual Directors in respect of Board procedures.</p>
			<p>The Company Secretary supports the Chairman in delivery of the agenda, in particular the planning of the annual cycle of Board and Board Committee meetings, and ensures that information is made available to Board members in a timely fashion. He also advises the Directors on Board procedures and corporate governance matters.</p>
			<p>The Company Secretary was appointed in November 2014. He is Secretary to all the Board committees as well. The Company Secretary is an Attorney-at-Law and an Associate member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, United Kingdom.</p>
			<p>The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.</p>
			<h3>Internal control and risk management </h3>
			<p>The Board ensures that internal controls and risk management are properly established and maintained through the Audit Committee whose responsibility is to oversee internal control and risk management. The Board was directly involved in assessing the risks associated with the business and of the Company through the Risk Management process. Continual monitoring is established and built into work processes assessing new and potential risks from a bottom-up flow. </p>
			<h3>Strategic Governance Boards (SGB)</h3>
			<p>Strategic Governance Board comprising the CEO and the Chief Officers of each functional area are given the responsibility of studying the requirements of cross functional areas and introducing solutions in a transparent manner. </p>
			<p>The six cross functional governance boards previously introduced have reduced to four in an attempt to improve in capital investment decision, enhance supply chain management and better utilisation of Group resources. </p>
			<h3>Codes of Conduct and Practice</h3>
			<p>SLT has a code of conduct that applies to all employees and third parties who deal with the Company. The Code sets out principles to guide employees in carrying out their duties and responsibilities to the highest standards of personal and corporate integrity when dealing with SLT, its competitors, customers, suppliers and the community. The processes and standards in the Code are intended to enhance investor confidence and rapport, and to ensure that decision-making is properly carried out in the best interests of the Group. The Code covers areas such as equal opportunity employment practices, workplace health and safety, conduct in the workplace, business conduct, protection of SLT’s assets, proprietary information and intellectual property, data protection, confidentiality, conflict of interest, and non-solicitation of customers and employees. The code is posted on SLT’s internal website. Policies and standards are clearly stipulated to guide employees in carrying out their daily tasks.</p>
			<h3>Material Contracts</h3>
			<p>There are no material contracts entered into by SLT or any of its subsidiaries that involve the interests of the CEO, any Director, or the controlling shareholders, Secretary to the Treasury and the Global Telecommunications Holdings, N.V.</p>
			<h3>Remuneration</h3>
			<p>SLT’s CEO is the head of management and is, therefore, remunerated as part of Senior Management. The R &amp; NC recommends the salary package of the CEO to commensurate with his qualifications and experience for the approval of the Board. The CEO’s performance is assessed based on key performance indicators agreed upon with him.</p>
			<h3>Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors</h3>
			<p>The R &amp; NC reviews and proposes the Non-Executive Directors’ fees based on experience and skills of the Directors and the complexity of the Group’s business and operations, for the approval of the Board.</p>
			<p>Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were revised in July 2018 in commensurate with their engagement and time spent on complex issues of the Company.</p>
			<p>The fees for non-executive Directors other than the Chairman comprised a fee for attendance at Board and Board’s subcommittee meetings. The cost of travelling and accommodation incurred by the overseas Directors who were required to travel out of their country to attend Board and sub-committee meetings is reimbursed.</p>
			<p>The aggregate Directors’ fees paid to non-executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 was LKR 16 Mn.</p>
			<p>Mr W K H Wegapitiya, who was appointed to the Board in December 2015 has declined to accept a director fee and offered his monthly director fee to a charitable organisation. </p>
			<h3>Remuneration of Senior Management</h3>
			<p>The remuneration framework and policy is designed to support implementation of the Group’s strategy and enhance shareholder value. </p>
			<p>The following are the principles for remuneration to Senior Management:</p>
			<ul class="list list-disc">
				<li>Select appropriate performance metrics for annual and long-term incentive plans to support business strategies and ongoing enhancement of shareholder value</li>
				<li>Offer competitive packages to attract and retain highly experienced and talented individuals</li>
				<li>Link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance, both on an annual and long-term basis</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting </h3>
			<p>The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors, and all shareholders are encouraged to participate. Chairpersons of subcommittees will be available at the AGM to answer any questions from shareholders. </p>
			<h3>Major transactions</h3>
			<p>The Board of Directors, as required by the Companies Act, discloses to shareholders all proposed corporate transactions detailing all facts associated with such transactions that are of material value to SLT. There were no major transactions entered into by SLT for the year 2018. </p>
			<h3>Related party transactions</h3>
			<p>The Board of Directors has applied the rules issued by the CSE on related party transactions throughout its decision-making process to avoid any conflicts of interest that may occur. The Board has recognised the importance of a Related Party Transactions Committee under the Board of Directors to enhance corporate transparency and promote fair transactions between SLT and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, a RPTRC was formed comprising three Non-Executive Independent Directors with the objective of ensuring that the interests of shareholders are taken into account when entering into RPTs.</p>
			<p>The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries as disclosed in <a href="../financial-reports/notes-to-the-financial-statements.html#note34" target="_blank">Note 34</a> of the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, the Board believes those transactions are exempted in accordance with exceptions specified in the Code of Best Practices on Related Party Transactions issued by the SEC. All these are recurrent transactions and are in the ordinary course of business of the Company.</p>
			<h3>Statement of Compliance</h3>
			<p>SLT is fully compliant with the requirements stipulated in Section 7.10 on “Corporate Governance” of the Continuing Listing Requirements of the Colombo Stock Exchange issued in 2010 and subsequent amendments/guidelines thereto. See the tables below for the rules on “Corporate Governance principles” and the degree of compliance to the said rules. </p>
			<p>In addition, the Board of Directors to the best of their knowledge and belief is satisfied that all statutory payments due to the Government, other regulatory bodies and those payments related to employees of SLT, have been made in a timely manner.</p>
