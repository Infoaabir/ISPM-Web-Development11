<span class="th3"><strong>Risk Management</strong></span>
<br>
<br>

<p>Successful implementation of Business plan and Strategy comes with effective treatment of risks and opportunities.</p>

<p>At the business planning stage, SLT identifies the potential opportunities in the market; subsequently action plans are developed to achieve these objectives.</p>

<p>Identification of risks which may hamper the achievement of objectives, is also one of the essential components of SLT Annual Business Planning process.</p>

<p>As an incumbent telecommunication company, SLT faces the challenge of sustaining in the market under the swiftly changing technological and regulatory environment. When benchmarked with the telecommunication industries in the region, Sri Lanka is among the countries which have high industry risks. This is mainly driven by the economic situation, high competition in the industry and low penetration and technology adoption in the country. Telecommunication services are positioned at low profit margins, while the underlying investments are significantly high.</p>

<span class="th4">Establishing an ERM framework</span>
<p>During the year 2011, SLT has taken initiatives in establishing a formal risk management culture across the organization. A special organizational transformation project named 'Enterprise Risk Management' was carried out with the vision of making SLT a risk intelligent organization. The initial phase of this project delivered a risk management framework to SLT and relevant awareness and communication materials. Several awareness sessions were carried out to improve the risk management awareness among executives. A significant improvement in applying formal risk management process with project management practices could be witnessed during the year.</p>

<p>The subsequent phases of ERM targets to further establish the risk management culture in the organization. This will formalize the risk reporting and will further improve the awareness among all the staff in the organization. This exercise will lead to the development of Key Risk Indicators for the company.</p>

<span class="th4">Risks from the Operating Environment</span>
<p>Telecommunication industry bears a significant contribution towards national economic development. The year 2011 recorded a significant growth in economy in which tourism, hotel and banking sectors have shown significant performances. Telecommunication industry was a key driver behind the development of above services. The emergance of increasing and novel telecommunication needs has fueled the development of the industry. This has resulted in initiation of new telecommunication development projects all over the island by most of the operators.</p>

<p>SLT initiated one of its mega projects, i-Sri Lanka during the year. This brings a novel technological concept to Sri Lanka. Apart from the opportunities created by i-Sri Lanka, there are significant risk  factors associated with the huge investment to be done in this project.</p>

<p>The year 2011, has shown further decline in the CDMA market, which eventually resulted in losses for 'CDMA only' operators. The growing demand in Broadband services has been the driver in SLT's fixed wired telephones. This demand has provided opportunity for SLT to sustain in the market under this difficult situation.</p>

<p>The 'Next Generation Network's are opening the opportunity to deliver diverse traffic over a single network. SLT's network upgrades towards an islandwide NGN, has created the opportunity for SLT to become the National Backbone for Telecommunication services.  This saves unnecessary investments on duplicated resources, while it helps to provide optimum service to customers.</p>

<span class="th4">Regulatory Risks</span><br />
<span class="th5">Licence</span>
<p>SLT license which was effective for 20 years expired on 08th August, 2011. As a response to the renewal request made by SLT to TRC, the prevailed license was extended for another 06 months from August, 2011 until the license conditions related to the National Backbone Network (NBN) are finalized. In accordance with the Cabinet Decision where TRC was appointed to negotiate with SLT for establishment of NBN, TRC decided to incorporate the license conditions related to NBN also into the new license of SLT. Hence, negotiations to finalize the same terms and conditions are still in progress.</p>

<span class="th5">National Backbone Network (NBN)</span>
<p>Discussions and negotiations related to National Backbone Network (NBN) are being carried out between SLT and TRC. The obligations pertaining to NBN operation will be imposed to SLT via the license conditions to establish the NBN within a regulated framework. With the implementation of NBN, the NBN services will replace the existing backbone services of SLT Wholesale, which have to be provided under the regulated terms.</p>

<span class="th5">Regulation of Tariffs</span>
<p>The prevailing price war especially in the international voice market and in the broadband market is leading towards a very difficult situation for SLT. The implications are such that sustainability of the revenues has become an issue which has ultimately resulted in eroding of margins of the same services.</p>

<p>As a measure of addressing the price war in the domestic voice market TRC imposed floor rates and the need of floor rates even for data services has become a timely requirement.</p>

<p>Although substantial price reductions were introduced during 2011, specifically for the international backhauling service, the increase in demand was not up to the expectation as foreseen by TRC. Hence, any further pressures from industry to bring down the prices may create adverse impacts on SLT, which will lead to further revenue drops due to tariff reductions.</p>

<span class="th4">Legal Risks</span><br />
<span class="th5">Litigation</span>
<p>It must be noted that it is impractical to forecast the outcome of any particular case or the amount of any possible verdict in respect of ongoing litigation. Nevertheless, the defences taken in those cases have the judicious features of both the law and the facts. However it is unlikely that the final outcome of any particular litigation may materially affect the operations or cash flows of the Company.</p>

<p>SLT is a party to several court and out-of-court proceedings with other parties and detailed below is the summary of the meterial litigation these proceeded during 2011.</p>

<ul>
<li>Global Electroteks Limited has initiated legal action under High Court Case No. 20/2006 claiming damages of USD 12 Million from SLT PLC for alleged unlawful disconnection of interconnection services.</li>
<li>Just in Time Holding (Pvt) Ltd filed a case against SLT in ICLP Arbitration Centre. JIT is claming USD 4,738,846.57, as payments due to them from SLT under the contract. SLT has lodged a counterclaim of Rs. 437,970,137.00 Under its Statements of Defense.</li>
<li>Legal action filed by SLT against Colombo Municipal Council, against the arbitrary increase of assessment value for Head Quarter premises from 84 million to Rs. 96 million. The quarterly assessment tax in 2006 was increased from Rs. 7,350,000/- to Rs. 8,452,5000/-.</li>
<li>Legal action was initiated by H/S Communication Ltd. against SLT & SLT Vision Com Ltd. seeking stay order against airing of certain channels by SLT VisionCom (Pvt) Ltd. And to recover arrears of US $ 486,000/- SLT made representations and no stay order was granted, and HS Communication Ltd withdrew their application for the stay order. But the main claim against SLT and SLT VisionCom Ltd is proceeding.</li>
</ul>

<span class="th4">HR Related Risks</span>
<p>In the context of changing telecom business models; the human capital is exceedingly important. Employee skill development and employee retention are the most challenging functions in the present industry scenario. SLT has been successful in molding existing employees according to future requirements, while maintaining one of the lowest employee turnover ratios in the industry.</p> 

<p>SLT faces the challenge of managing a diverse employee base which totals over 6,000. There are over 35 active employee unions. Maintaining healthy union interaction with management and keeping industrial harmony is imperative for the well being of the company. SLT was able to solve industrial conflicts which occurred during the year, providing long term solutions in agreement with all the employee unions, management and shareholders.</p>

<span class="th4">Financial Risk</span>
<p>SLT continues to adopt a holistic approach in managing financial risk. Accordingly, the company has developed following financial risk management measurements to mitigate these risks. Through training and management standards and procedures, SLT aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.</p>

<span class="th4">Exchange Rate (FX) Risk</span>
<p>Foreign Exchange Risk is a major source of Market Risk and is unavoidable in any entity where re-pricing of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities are not identically matched. The company manages its Foreign Exchange exposure by maintaining foreign currency accounts for related inflows and using same for paying off some of its Liabilities in Foreign Currency. This serves as an effective hedging mechanism against Foreign Currency exposure. As a further measure, only optimum amounts are maintained in these Foreign Currency accounts and any excesses are converted to SLT's base currency (LKR) after carefully studying the future forecasts of the currency movements.</p>

<span class="th4">Interest Rate Risk</span>
<p>Interest rate Risk mainly arises as a result of SLT having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly impacted by changes in the Interest Rates. The Company's debt and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.</p>

<span class="th4">Liquidity Risk</span>
<p>Liquidity Risk is risk that an entity may not be able to meet its payment commitments due to unforeseen factors or be forced to borrow funds on unfavourable terms. In order to manage this risk, SLT employs regular financial planning and monitoring systems to ensure that sufficient cash flows are available to meet all financial commitments on time.</p>

<span class="th4">Credit Risk</span>
<p>The possibility of losses arising from the diminution in the credit quality of debtors can be considered the Credit risk. This Risk may not be limited to Balance Sheet items, but can also arise as a result of Off-Balance Sheet items such as Financial Guarantees. Comprehensive systems and procedures are in place to monitor and evaluate debtors and recoveries of the company. Further, Pre-paid sales are used as a means of mitigating Credit risk.
