<span class="th4">2	&nbsp;&nbsp;BASIS OF PREPARATION</span> <br />
<span class="th5">(a)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of compliance</span> <p>"The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS) as laid down by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka(ICASL) and the requirements of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.</p>

<p>The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 17 February 2012.</p>

<span class="th5">(b)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Basis of measurement</span> <p>"The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except foreign operations which are accounted as explained in Notes 3(b) to the Financial Statements.</p>

<p>The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.</p>

<span class="th5">(c)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Functional and presentation currency</span> <p>"These financial statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Company's functional currency, and the Group's presentation currency. All financial information presented in Sri Lankan rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.</p>

<span class="th5">(d)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of estimates and judgements</span> <p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SLASs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>

<p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.</p>

<p>Information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in notes;</p>

  </ul>

  <span class="th5">(e)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in Accounting policies</span> <p>No changes in accounting policies have taken place during the year 2011.</p>


  <span class="th4">3	&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSISTENCY IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span> <p>The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities. Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to confirm with the current year's presentation.</p>

  <span class="th5">(a)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Basis of consolidation</span> <em><span class="th5"><br />
  (i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiaries</span></em> <p>Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.</p>

<p>The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
</p>
<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions eliminated on consolidation</span></em> <p>Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.</p>

<span class="th5">(b)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency</span> <br />
<em><span class="th5">(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency transactions</span></em> <p>Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at average of buying and selling exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange differences arising on the settlement or reporting of the Company's monetary items at rates different from those which were initially recorded are dealt in the Income Statement. Unrealised gains and losses are dealt with through the Income Statement.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign operations</em></span> 
<p>The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to rupees at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to rupees at average exchange rates.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the exchange equalisation reserve.</p>

<span class="th5">(c)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment<br />

<em>(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition and measurement</em></span> <p>Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. As disclosed in Note 14 where property, plant and equipment of the Department of Telecommunications were transferred to Sri Lanka Telecom at a valuation performed by the Government of Sri Lanka and was used as the opening cost of fixed assets.</p>

<p>Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.</p>

<p>When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent costs</span></em> <p>The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(iii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation</em></span> <p>Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset is put in to use and no depreciation will be charged to the month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.</p>

<p>The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(iv)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Work-in-Progress</em></span> <p>Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalization.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(v)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Derecognition</span></em> <p>The carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant & Equipment is derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal . Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within "other income" in profit or loss.</p>

<p>When replacement costs are recognized in the carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Major inspection costs are capitalized. At each such capitalization, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognized.</p>

<span class="th5">(d)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible assets</span> <br />
<em><span class="th5">(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill</span></em> <p>Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.</p>

<p>Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of exchange.</p>

<p>Subsequent measurement<br />

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Other intangible assets</span></em> <p>Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(iii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Licenses</em></span> 
<p>Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. Expenditures on license fees   that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than one financial year is classified as license  fee and is being amortized over the License period on a straight line basis.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(iv)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent expenditure</em></span> 
<p>Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(v)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortisation</span></em> <p>Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:</p>

<p>Software     3- 5 years</p>

<span class="th5">(e)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Leased assets</span>
<p>Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. For operating leases, the leased assets are not recognised on the Group's balance sheet.</p>

<span class="th5">(f)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories</span> <p>Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories , conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.Mobitel computes cost of inventories on FIFO basis.</p>

<span class="th5">(g)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Impairment</span> <p><span>Non-financial assets</span> <br />
  The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.</p>

<p>The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit"). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.</p>

<p>An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.</p>

<p>An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.</p>

<span class="th5">(h)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Grants</span> <p>Other government grants are recognised initially at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments</em></span> <p>The long term investments are initially recognised at cost and provision is only made where, in the opinion of the Directors, there is a permanent diminution in value. Where there has been a permanent diminution in the value of an investment, it is recognised as an expense in the period in which the diminution is identified. On disposal of an investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the income statement.</p>

<span class="th5">(j)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade receivables</span> <p>Trade receivables are carried at anticipated realizable value. An estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on review of all outstanding amounts at the year end. Bad debts are written off during the year in which they are identified.</p>

<span class="th5">(k)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents</span> <p>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and  deposits with original maturities of three months or less. The cash flow has been prepared using the indirect method in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard 9 - 'Cash Flow Statements'.</p>

<span class="th5">(l)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Stated capital</span> <p>Ordinary shares<br />

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.</p>

<span class="th5">(m)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings</span> <p>Borrowings include bank borrowings. They are accounted at the gross value of the outstanding balance.</p>

<span class="th5">(n)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee benefits</span> <br />
<em><span class="th5">(1)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Defined contribution plans</span></em> <p>A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which contributions are made into a separate fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during services is rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(1.1)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Provident Fund</span></em> <p>All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 15% of such employees' basic salary and allowances. All employees of subsidiaries of the Group except for Sri Lanka Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited and SLT Services (Private) Ltd are members of Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), to which respective subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees' basic salary and allowances. Employees of SLT Services (Private) Ltd are members of Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), where the company contribute 15% of such employees' basic salary and allowances.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(1.2)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Trust Fund</em></span> <p>The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the salary of each employee to the Employees' Trust Fund.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(2)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Defined benefit plans</em></span> <p>A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The valuation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the valuation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.</p>

<p>When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans directly in the income statement.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(3)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination benefits</span></em> <p>Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(4)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term benefits</span></em> <p>Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.</p>

<p>A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.</p>

<span class="th5">(o)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions</span> <p>A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.</p>

<span class="th5">(p)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue</span> <p>Revenue from services rendered in the course of ordinary activities is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of trade discounts ,volume rebates and after eliminating the sales within the Group.</p>

<p>Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence exist , usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable , there is no continuing management involvement with the services rendered, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.</p>

<p>If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognized as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognized.</p>

<p>The revenue is recognised as follows:</p>

<em><span class="th5">(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic and international call revenue, rental income</span></em> <p>Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as revenue as services are performed, with unbilled revenue resulting from services already provided accrued at the end of each period.</p>
<p>Fixed rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation to the period of services rendered.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from other network operators and international settlements</span></em> <p>The revenue received from other network operators, local and international, for the use of the Group's telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.</p>

<p>Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and data traffic between other telecommunications operators is recognised at the time of transit across the group's network and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued is recognised under income in the income statement and interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs in the income statement.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(iii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from broadband</span></em> <p>Revenue from Data services and IPTV services is recognized on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.</p>

<span class="th5">(iv)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from other telephony services</span> <p>The revenue from other telephony services are recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered between the Group and subscribers.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(v)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Connection fees</span></em> <p>The connection fees relating to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. Revenue is recognized on an annual basis irrespective of the date of connection.</p>

<p>The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue in the period in which the connection is activated.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(vi)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Agreements revenue</span></em> <p>Capacity contracts which do not convey the right to use a specified capacity in an identified fiber cable are accounted as service arrangements. Revenues from capacity contracts under service arrangements are recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry date of the contract and releases the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining unamortized deferred revenue is recognized in the period the contract is terminated.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(vii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepaid Card revenue</span></em> <p>Revenue from the sale of prepaid card on CDMA, Internet is deferred until such time as the customer uses the call time, downloadable quota or the credit expires.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(viii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Sales</span></em> <p>Revenue from sale of equipment is recognised, net of taxes, on completion of the transaction.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ix)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of services</span></em> <p>Revenue from fixed - price contracts for providing manpower is generally recognised in  the period of the services are provided. Revenue from fixed-price contracts for delivering network project services is recognized under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method. Under the POC method, revenue is generally recognized based on the services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed.</p>

<p>Revenue from publication sales relating to advertising revenue is recognised on publishing the advertisement in the telephone directory and a copy delivered to the subscriber on percentage of completion method.</p>

<span class="th5">(q)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure</span>
<p>The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit for the year.</p>

<span class="th5">(r)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Lease payments</span>
<p>Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.</p>

<p>Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.</p>

<p>Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.</p>

<span class="th5">(s)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance income and expenses</span>
<p>Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, gains on the disposal of fixed assets and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date.</p>

<p>Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, dividends on preference shares classified as liabilities, and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss.</p>

<p>Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.</p>

<span class="th5">(t)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax</span> <p>Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Current Taxation</span></em> <p>Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred Taxation</span></em> <p>Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
</p>
<p>A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(iii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Service Charge (ESC)</span></em> <p>ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed payment can be carried forward and set off against the income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.</p>

<span class="th5">(u)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings per share</span> <p>The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.</p>

<span class="th5">(v)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance reserve</span> <p>The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings an amount equal to 0.1% of additions to property, plant and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover any losses arising from damage to property, plant and equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured with a third party insurer.</p>

<span class="th5">(w)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividend distribution</span> <p>Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognized at the time the dividend recommended and declared by the Board of Directors, is approved by the shareholders.</p>

<span class="th5">(x)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparatives</span> <p>Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in respect of the previous period. Where the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements are amended, comparative amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable</p>

<span class="th5">(y)	&nbsp;&nbsp;New Accounting standards issued but not effective as at balance sheet date</span> <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) has issued a new volume of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards â€“ 2011, applicable for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. These Standards have many changes and consequential changes. The new Accounting Standards are prefixed both SLFRS and LKAS which correspond to the relevant IFRS and IAS. Disclosure requirement under SLAS 10.30 and 10.31 have been exempted by the ICASL and therefore all differences and impacts arising from the new Standards are not presented in these Financial Statements.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments</em></span> 
<p>LKAS 39 requires all financial assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised on the balance sheet on transition at 1 January 2012 would be immaterial.</p>

<p>Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are required to be recorded at amortised cost under LKAS 39. The majority of this amortised cost value was reflected on the balance sheet but elements were separately recorded in current assets and current liabilities. These amounts will be reclassified on transition to either financial assets or loans and borrowings to recognise the respective instruments at amortised cost.</p>

<p>Staff loans given at concessionary interest rates are required to be fair valued and any differences on fair value measurement need to be recognized as a prepaid staff cost and amortized over the term of the loan.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue</span></em> <p>The group has historically recognised revenue arising from connection fees relating to PSTN over a deferred period of 15 years. However, under SLFRS this will be recognized based on the expected customer life on the network. Which is depending on external variable factors such as, customer churn patterns, market conditions, competition, change in technologies and other external factors.</p>

<p>This adjustment described above would result in accelerated revenue recognition on PSTN deferred connection revenue.</p>

<p>Further installation fees for IPTV, Broadband, CDMA and upfront charges for wholesale services such as IPLC, DPLC and Ethernet which were historically recognized immediately, would also be recognized as deferred revenue based on the expected customer life on the network. The change in this estimation will be for new connections of such services and would create a deferred income liability on the balance sheet.</p>

<p>The monthly rental charged for the equipment provided to customers by SLT under fixed line services for PSTN CDMA, IPTV and Data need to be recognized separately as operating lease income, and the corresponding equipment will be recognized as a   leased asset  in the books of SLT.</p>

	<span class="th5">Property Plant & Equipment</span> <p>Property, plant and equipment comprising individual components for which different depreciation methods or rates are appropriate, require to be depreciated separately. Further PPE should be re-assessed for their useful life on an annual basis to include fully depreciated assets as well.</p>

<p>Further investments made in PPE with intangible components need to be classified as intangible assets and amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset.</p>

<p>SLT has the first time adoption exemption to revalue the assets at the date of transition. The revalued amounts are considered as the deemed cost of the asset. SLT does not have to apply the deemed cost exemption to all classes of PPE or to all items within a class of PPE; rather the exemption may be applied to individual items of PPE.</p>

<p>The resulting impact with regard to the above adjustments are in the process of being identified and the quantification is yet to be performed by the company.</p>

<span class="th5">(z)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial risk management</span> <br />
<em><span class="th5">(i)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk management framework</span></em> <p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.</p>

<p>The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.</p>

<p>The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.</p>

<span class="th5"><em>(ii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit risk</em></span> 
<p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(iii)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity risk</span></em>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.</p>

<em><span class="th5">(iv)	&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital management</span></em> <p>The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future evelopment of the business. Capital consists of stated capital, reserves and non-controlling interests of the Group. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.</p>

<p>The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.</p>

<p>In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.</p>

<p>During 2011, the Group's strategy, which was unchanged from 2010, was to maintain the gearing ratio below 35%. The gearing ratios at 31 December 2011 and 2010 were as follows:</p>
