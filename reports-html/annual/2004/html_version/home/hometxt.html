    <td><span class="annumaintxt">Sri Lanka Telecom has truly come of age. We 
      are the pioneer telecommunications service provider to Sri Lanka. Over time, 
      we&#8217;ve built up our technological base to one of clear supremacy as 
      Sri Lanka&#8217;s only fully integrated telecommunications service provider. 
      </span> <p class="annumaintxt">SLT has been voted Sri Lanka&#8217;s No.1 
        Corporate entity in 2004, by LMD,<br>
        and Sri Lanka&#8217;s No.1 Company in terms of networth, by Dun and Bradstreet.<br>
        This year, in keeping with our vision, we began to &#8220;look outwards&#8221;; 
        to explore the diversity of opportunity that lay before us in the international 
        telecommunications world; to set our sights on establishing SLT as a premier 
        regional telecommunications operator.</p>
      <p class="annumaintxt">Within the pages of this report you will find an 
        account of the direction in which this freshly charted course is taking 
        us; to greater global connectivity through several strategic partnerships 
        as well as the starting up of several international services; to an enhanced 
        capacity to seize opportunities that lie along this course, through the 
        ongoing introduction of ever evolving state-of-the-art technology.</p>
      <p class="annumaintxt">The excitement has not left the world of telecommunications. 
        Indeed, it is continuing to drive our passion to excel. It is causing 
        us to pause and reflect on whether &#8220;telecommunications&#8221; as 
        a nomenclature, does true justice to the direction in which this field 
        is moving, embracing as it does technology beyond &#8220;the fixed line&#8221; 
        concept; beyond &#8220;mobile&#8221; even.</p>
      <p class="annumaintxt">One thing is clear. Sri Lanka Telecom has been carefully 
        positioned along this new course with a clear intent. That of successfully 
        and profitably grasping the opportunities that lie before us, providing 
        an ever growing portfolio of products and services to a growing and more 
        discerning customer base, whilst strengthening the Company and offering 
        maximum returns to shareholders. We will accomplish all this with the 
        greatest adherence to responsibility, transparency and good ethics.</p></td>
